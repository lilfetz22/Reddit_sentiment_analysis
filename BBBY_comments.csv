26,"Of course, I enjoy the discussion :) 

You are right, they will likely not telegraph the fakt that they´ll dilute, which means the price-crash will be pretty much as unsuspected as the thursday crash when trading got shut down. This however limits the useful stock options down to BBBY, but i believe that currently BBBY wont have the necessary masses of people behind it just yet. I for one missed GME, but I am wary of placing money into AMC just like that, especially now since I believe you have a valid point of which many people are simply not aware.

So... we should make sure to set up the BBBY-run as soon as possible and spread that news, right? Because otherwise people will just be busy with amc, nkd and whatnot. How does one do that though? (New to reddit, so honestly no idea... sry :/)",2021-01-31 22:02:49
27,BBBY also moves almost exactly the same as GME based on what I’ve watched over the last week. AMC to a lesser degree.,2021-01-31 22:02:25
28,Solvent is having cash to service debt and free cash flow to pay down future debt. AMC has a small amount of cash but they have no path to generating future cash. GME and BBBY are actual turn around businesses that reduced their debt levels and even bought back shares by raising FCF and selling off non-core assets.,2021-01-31 22:01:44
29,"Anybody look at Melvins 2nd largest short position?

$BBBY!",2021-01-31 21:52:12
30,Hey thanks for the thoughtful response. I don’t think AMC will hit 100 and I think it’s a tough hold because the management will not give warning before they do an offering and that offering could be big enough to really crash the share price. I agree that we can’t be divided if we want this to work but we also can’t throw our capital at stocks that will get diluted because that is a permanent transfer from the squeeze to bond holders. It basically reduces the amount of capital we have for squeezing (which is why I think hedge funds are promoting these dilution prone stocks). 100% GME is the move but for people that missed GME the only other candidate that could moon is BBBY,2021-01-31 21:50:07
31,"what do you think about short term goals for amc, thoug? I guess it´ll go up at least a little bit, thoug i find it really hard to set a specific goal. But judging by the current hype for amc, it should likely hit a 100, perhaps? Of course, if amc gets diluted, it makes sense to get out of it and into BBBY asap, so i agree on that. 

&#x200B;

Also, I do belive that hedge funds are playing these forums by now, so we should be aware of that. Especially regarding possible gains from many different stocks, so that everybody here starts branching out over several different ones, because obviously, if we are divided, nothing will work the way it did with GME.",2021-01-31 21:45:40

41,Good posts you guys. The key difference is not the sector but actually the debt levels. GME and BBBY can allow the squeeze to play out but AMC has a fiduciary responsibility to sell shares because they are insolvent.

44,"I will say that I think AMC is not a good play right now AND SLV is not either. GME is still the best. If you have heard of S3 Partners (they update SI% daily. AMC is only at 15.7% or so now). It was at 60% just a few weeks ago. Finviz and these other places only report 2x a month. Once at the beginning and once around the 15th. I own GME and AMC. However I have the shortsight.com app. IMO, AMC's squeeze potential is there but I PERSONALLY wouldn't expect much at all. I hope it's up to 100 Monday since I own it, but we have BETTER options. 
THE HIGHEST SI% I KNOW OF AS OF FRIDAY: GME-113%, BBBY/LGND/FUBO-65%, SPWR-58%, MAC/SKT- MID 50s.

45,"Thank you for posting this. My father’s gambling of stock futures destroyed my family and my childhood, and his addiction eventually turned a successful guy with multiple Ivy League degrees and $1 million in inheritance into a bankrupt dude living out of his car and making ends meat working at a call center. Even as an adult I am still facing the prospect of paying $1000s in legal fees and forgoing inheritance from my stepmom so we can protect her money from him without a conflict of interest if she dies. This GME thing is the first time I’m buying individual stocks, and that is only because this is the first and last time we are likely to see a collective action that can so effectively make wall street pay. Don’t put in more than you can comfortably lose. If you would be ashamed to tell someone off this site how much you lost that’s a sign it’s too much. Don’t stay in after the GME hype. The casino always wins, except when you smash and grab them like what I think is still happening right now (but who can say if we will win the next round of this fight — they are playing dirty and can change the rules at any time as they see fit, as we’ve already seen). Stay strong, buy and hold what you can to hurt Wall Street and help your brothers! If you get in late like I did don’t expect to get rich off this though.

So like a lot of newbies on here. Idk shit. I set out months ago to teach myself how to use the stock market, but alas, I struggle with ADHD and I got as far as downloading some kindle books, podcast, and audio books and then got distracted trying to read 3000+ bills. 🥲 Kicking myself now, but I can only go forward! 

I’m a broke bitch. Like, I got $100 or less to throw on some stocks. I’ve been up until 3am every night reading r/web, googing info, reading articles, etc to do this on my own. But with crunch time seemingly near and so much conflicting information, my head is spinning.

My question to all of you wonderful folks: Has the shipped sailed? Would it be worth it to buy $AMC, $NOK, $BB, $BBBY, or any of the other cheaper but not so extravagant shorted stocks at this point? Should I pick one or divide my shares between them if so? Should I just accept that it’s done and save my money for when I’m able to learn more? 

I’m new so I wasn’t able to post this on its own. :(

I consider myself a part time adrenaline junky who enjoys some mild to moderate risk. As much as I like sticking it to the Man, I like money, too.

Melvin Capital Management, the hedge fund that has borne the brunt of losses from the soaring stock prices of heavily shorted stocks recently, lost 53% in January, according to people familiar with the firm.

Melvin was founded by Gabe Plotkin, a former star portfolio manager for hedge-fund titan Steven A. Cohen. It started the year with about $12.5 billion and now runs more than $8 billion. 

The current figure includes $2.75 billion in emergency funds Citadel LLC, its partners and Mr. Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management injected into the hedge fund last Monday.

As part of the deal, they got noncontrolling revenue shares in Melvin for three years. So far, Citadel, its partners and Point72 have lost money on the deal, though the precise scope of the loss was unclear Sunday.

Melvin has massively de-risked its portfolio, a client said. People familiar with the hedge fund said its leverage ratio—the value of its assets compared with its capital from investors—was the lowest it has been since Melvin’s 2014 start. They also said the company’s position-level liquidity, or its ability to exit securities in its portfolio easily, had increased significantly.

New and existing clients have signed up to invest money into Melvin on Feb. 1, according to the people familiar with the matter. It was unclear how much they would be adding.

Melvin had established itself in recent years as one of the top hedge funds on Wall Street, but a short position in GameStop Corp. GME 67.87% hurt the firm in recent weeks. Losses extended beyond GameStop, with declines coming from throughout its portfolio during a period of market turmoil in January. Positions in which Melvin had publicly disclosed owning put options—bearish contracts that typically profit as stocks fall—in its last quarterly regulatory filing soared, while positions in companies it held sold off.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., BBBY 5.02% New York-listed Chinese tutoring company GSX Techedu Inc. GSX 0.24% and National Beverage Corp. FIZZ -3.58% were up 78.4%, 62% and 99% at their intraweek highs last week, respectively. Meanwhile, Booking Holdings Inc. BKNG -4.41% and Expedia Group Inc. EXPE -2.08% were down 9.9% and 13.4% at their intraweek lows.

Traders say as GameStop continued to soar—from $30 to $75 and higher—there was a contagion effect. Managers lost confidence that short positions would stop rising in value and covered heavily shorted names, worried social media-fueled investors would focus on companies they were short. They also started cutting their stakes in companies to reduce the risk in their portfolios, hurting other investors in those companies. Last week alone, GameStop shares soared more than four times.

“The performance pain…has been record breaking,” read a note from Morgan Stanley MS -3.27% to its trading clients last week.

Indeed, hedge funds set near-daily records of various sorts last week for how much they pulled back their exposure to the U.S. stock market by covering their shorts and selling out of their wagers on companies, according to client notes from Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS -1.40% On Wednesday, this type of so-called degrossing contributed to the largest one-day drop in funds’ use of leverage on record, a Goldman note said.

Maplelane Capital, another hedge fund that has sustained significant losses this month, ended January with a roughly 45% loss, said a person familiar with the fund. It managed about $3.5 billion at the start of the year.

The frenetic trading that catapulted GameStop, AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. AMC 53.65% and BlackBerry Ltd. BB -3.75% into the ranks of the most traded stocks in the U.S. market and captured the attention of the White House and regulators also hit prominent hedge funds Point72 and D1 Capital Partners.

D1, which ended the month down about 20%, was short AMC and GameStop, said people familiar with the fund. One of the people said D1 had exited both positions by Wednesday morning but that those were small drivers of losses. A more significant factor was shares of travel-related companies declining.

Some fund managers say the episode is likely to change how the industry works.

Fewer hedge funds are likely to highlight their bearish positions by disclosing put options, they said. Instead, funds may use Securities and Exchange Commission rules to keep confidential those positions, a tool activist investors have long used to build positions in companies quietly. More funds also may institute rules about avoiding thinly traded, heavily shorted stocks.

138,"A sell off could’ve happened in any day, but it didn’t. All dips from the later half of last week were market manipulation (check volume if u don’t believe me). No brokerage restricted the ability to sell. The restrictions further my belief in the short squeeze. If we were the ones fucked why would they care? They wouldn’t. If their rich hedge fund buddies like melvin or citadel were fucked, it makes sense they are trying to help, hence limit on buying GME. 

I suspect they limited other popular stocks for one of two reasons: if they only limited GME it’s clear collusion, but if they limit other stocks they could argue “it’s for the protection of the trader”, or there are substantial short positions in the other stocks as well so the HFs want to limit losses (true for BBBY and AMC at least). If you believe the short float data by S3 partners and ortex, then yes, GME has room to at least quintuple. Look at VW in 08, we are not at the peak yet. The scariest part of this is honestly DeepFuckingValue. If he sells off then this is dead.

So, in your opinion, what is a realistic goal for BBBY share value and what for AMC? Because people will try to push AMC from monday on anyways, even if it is not similar to GME. With realistic i dont mean the old ""to the mooooon"" answer, but really what is possible in your opinion?

Also, it would make sense to spread this information so people will start going for BBBY once they finished AMC.",2021-01-31 12:51:59

218,"Literally ""If 4chan found a bloomberg terminal.""

If anyone thinks they're gonna have some cuddly safe space where we all push social justice and jerk each other off for twitter points after this, they're sorely mistaken. Politics means nothing here. Sociopolitical BS means less than nothing. Especially if it's not getting you paid.

I want my GME to make me money by the end of this. All this Diamond Hands and emoji spam and camaraderie is amazing and shit, but when this is all over, we won't really give a shit about each other beyond ""You held GME to the end, GJ."" or ""Fucking retard bought BBBY."" or some shit. 

We are allies, peers, and competitors, not friends. 

I'm still in if he's still in, but when he's out, I'm out too. Plain and simple. This is the stock market, not lesbian dance class. There's literally thousands of other subreddits for pointless feel-good bullshit. In this situation right the fuck now, that feel-good bullshit will cost us money. The people selling GME and AMC to donate to charities and buy billboards are Paper. Fucking. Handed. I have zero respect for anyone risking our gains, their gains, and my gains for optics when we haven't even hit the Gamma Squeeze.

There's the very real possibility that everyone holding GME and Co. right now loses everything in the course of a few minutes because one clueless retard sells one too many GME or buys too much of something worthless and Melvin, Citron, and Citadel make absolutely earth shattering gains off our failures with their doubling, tripling, quadrupling, and quintupling down on Shorting GME. 

If we fuck up, they make more money in an instant than we'd ever make from the Squeeze, and that's fucking saying something when Wall Street literally prints money for itself.

We are all trusting each other to not fuck this up. Our goal: Buy GME, hold till two brokers go supercritical and melt, and get a Ludicrous payday. Nothing more. Nothing less.

Well we got it.

I mean 1st I’d try to move accounts(which I’m sure you have attempted but are unable to) TD Ameritrade is what I use and it hasn’t been much of a dick 
then see if you can get into AMC BB or BBBY and if you can do any of that then either, put in the title of yr post that ppl should be prioritizing the squeeze AND/OR if you are anxious to play with ur money the market is pretty low Atm on non squeeze stocks.

>>My name is (**insert name**) and I am writing to you today as one of your constituents because of the injustice that retail investors such as myself have recently experienced at the hands of hedge funds. As you may have heard, on or around Thursday, January 28th, major trading platform brokerage Robinhood, among many others, restricted users from buying certain stocks, forcing shareholders to either hold or sell their positions. These brokerages prevented millions of users from buying stocks and options that retail traders were investing into like GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), Blackberry ($BB), and Bed Bath and Beyond ($BBBY) just to name a few. In fact, it is estimated that roughly half of all Robinhood users owned a position in GameStop when trading was halted.

Robinhood claims to have made the decision to halt trades on those specific stocks to “protect investors from market volatility.” This was a lie, of course. Previously, people could put as much money into a stock or options calls, and Robinhood would not care if you lost all of your money. If anything, the only people they were trying to protect were themselves and their sponsors. It wasn’t until retail investors began to make money that restrictions were put in place. Moreover, during the period in which investors were barred from buying more shares, hedge funds were allowed to trade as normal.

Truthfully, the SEC should have done something about the 140% short position that GameStop was experiencing before Wednesday.

381,"AMC and BBBY are heavily shorted and are very speculative, I have a small amount of each. NOK seems be at the base level, the safest bet. BB seems to be the next safest bet but more likely to rally than NOK. The rest of my portfolio is split 70% BB + 30% NOK.",2021-01-30 19:23:48
382,bbby is higher shorted.  B-BANG.,2021-01-30 19:22:28
383,"In my opinion, and this isn't advice, yadda yadda, before RH lumped these stocks together I thought of them very differently.

I saw GME as a undervalued over shorted stock that was rising, and had the potential for a short squeeze if those 140% numbers meant what I thought they meant.

I saw NOK and BB as companies that were reinventing themselves and we're basically long term high risk IPOs. Both are trying to become something different than what they were known for in the 1990s. I think of these as marky mark/david hasselhoff stocks. Maybe they'll make it in their new careers, maybe they'll end up doing porn.

Then AMC is interesting. They're a movie theater in a  pandemic. They're not in a good place. But there is a new administration who has a more adult approach to the virus (no politics rule please allow this, as it is significant), there is a vaccine or two and they're becoming available, and people will rush to theaters when we're able if only for the nostalgia of pre-covid life. Plus the big short squeeze movie will be an epic event when it comes out.

Now, BBBY is also interesting without regard to the short dqueeze. They're an old boring almost depressing store, also in the middle of a pandemic, trying to sell pillows in a world where people get their pillows in tiny shrink-wrapped containers from china from wallstreet darlings like purple. So they're also making big changes. Think they got a new ceo or chairman board member or something, idk, I read it when forgot it. But they're mixing it up. They're still in malls that are going bankrupt and still in a pandemic and their stores still smell funny so I'm not very bullish on them, but I could see how you could be.

So on say Monday, there were reasons for each of these companies to think they're at their low point and will rebound, and that's without knowing about shorts.

It's common for people to try to buy low and sell high and to have some speculation about which companies are in a position to rebound. Same is true for resorts, hotels, airlines, cruise ships, stadiums, etc.

But now there's something else to think about. These hedge funds have shorted this group of stocks in particular. And RH has attacked this group in particular, and people have tweeted and posted about this group in particular.

How are they related? What happens if a HF that has huge amounts of shorts on GME has to cover their GME stocks 

Well, if it were me, because I'm honest and not a crook, I'd have to liquidate my positions to get money to pay my debt. That means I'd have to sell my longs, even if at a loss, and sell my shorts, even if at a loss. 

So if someone is long on BABA and TSLA and AAPL and short on GME and AMC and BBBY and they hold massive positions that can move the price, and they are going to sell off, then in the short term the opposite of whatever they had will happen. Tsla, baba, aapl will drop, and amc and bbby will rise.

We saw aapl have best earnings ever and tank (and they want to lecture us about fundamentals.. smh). 

So my opinion is there is a short term play if you're a day trader (I'm not) to bet on good stocks falling and bad stocks rising just as a result of these guys liquidating.

There's a long term play to be bullish on some of these stocks based on fundamentals and you can think of this as a kickstart for them.

I personally hope tsla and aapl rebound, but I suppose you could argue there's a long term play for them to come crashing down to reality and this is a kickstart for them. I don't hold that position.

So (as of Monday) all four have a chance to go up based on just business reasons. Bbby and amc have a chance to go up based on knowing who has to sell their shorts, and the fact that RH restricted these together with gme lends support to they theory, but I don't think any of these will be a gme. Gmenis special in how over-shorted it is.

So a week ago I might argue that I think soon the movies will open back up and amc is a good price. Now if I could go back in time I'd think the movies might open back up and the stock is at a good price, and the shorts are going to take some time off, so amc might even make it until the vaccines are out.

Idk if 15 is still a good price, but 4 was. but we could be here in ahead and I'd be saying, wow, 15 was a deal. Idk. 

But aside from the squeeze there are legitimate reasons to buy any of these stocks, and same goes for things like airlines and hotels and all the Covid affected industries. Likewise, we're still not out of pandemic mode, so any of those companies could run out of money before we get vaccines and fail. So who knows.

Finally there's always a chance everything comes crashing down and we go into a great depression, so that's nice to think about too.",2021-01-30 19:21:50

Market value: $1.4 billion

Percentage of tradable shares held short: 59%

Specialty retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY, $10.96) is one of many big-box stores that have struggled mightily in the age of Amazon.com (AMZN).
Bed Bath was once the go-to source for wedding registries and families looking to dress up their first home. But a preponderance of e-commerce alternatives and more fashionable nameplates have emerged in the last decade or so to put the squeeze on this once-dominant housewares store.
As a result, revenues peaked for BBBY back in fiscal 2017 at more than $12.3 billion but have been pretty much been in free-fall ever since. Analysts are estimating just $9.5 billion in sales for 2020.
The pandemic has taken its toll, yes. But recent consumer spending trends have only exacerbated the multi-year crisis for this specialty retailer.

399,"I was an idiot that sold $20 of shares in GME Jan 15th. I fucked up. But that's ok.

I can't re enter GME because it will make me too emotional. I have been monitoring the AMC play and entered with 1000+ shares.

My reasoning is it was beat down by shorts to $2. Much like GME. It has returned to 2 year stock prices.

Since the return to 13$ prices, there was 29 million OTM calls that turned to ITM (19% of float if I remember) calls and short interest seems to have increased (although I'm having a hard time finding reliable SI and float percents.) Much more likely these calls were exercises at $1-$13 than any GME calls at 250+. NOT SAYING THAT IN A BAD WAY. Just realistic. If you bought a call for 200$, it would take 25000+ to exercise. 

Again. Power to the GME holders and stay strong, if it drops I have limit orders at 201$ to get back in begrudgingly.

The share dilution I remember reading kept stock near 13.50.

The primary share holder is a Chinese company you can find in their 13f filling, so I don't imagine they will be letting go of share anytime soon if they believe in their company.

And as price increases, like GME, greed will increase prompting others to short it. With all the holders and internal acting like restricted it could potentially be over 100% theoretically if you HOLD!!!

I wanna see solid numbers on the short interest on Monday and that should start to tell the story.

This weekend is a good time to contemplate possible moves next week leaving aside the company fundamentals, which are not very relevant here for short term trades, and looking at the psychology of the crowd and profit / loss for institutions. For stocks other than GME.

Up:

\- Some shorts may cover stocks with high short interest (AMC BBBY) out of fear of being squeezed like GME.

\- Profit taking in GME may roll into other stocks.

\- Diamond hands that have not dumped yet may want to ride out the paper loss.

\- Momentum traders including institutions now have it on their watch list and may join any move up accelerating it.

\- There is not much upside pushing not heavily shorted stocks lower because there are investors supporting the price hence low short interest in the first place.

\- I don't know for sure but possibly not all short interest is public? Also high short volume this week will need to be covered.

\- The options expiration is over and another rally at the beginning of the week may be permissible before bringing it to the next options expiration MM consensus price.

Down:

\- Traders that usually fade rallies on no news will get at overbought stocks.

\- Downside pressure may be applied further by institutions to flush out paper hands via psychological pressure, stop loss orders and margin calls.

\- Once the stocks enjoy any bump in price paper hands that are underwater will dump impeding any positive momentum.

Don't decide what you do based on what I think but here is the bear case for the catalyst for the GME sell-off:

The events of last Friday's gamma squeeze triggered the stocks run-up and possible short squeeze action we saw this week.

My thoughts are based on the market events of Wednesday 1/27.

From Melvin Capital's most recent quarterly holdings filing (which can be read publicly here: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1628110/000090571820001111/xslForm13F_X01/infotable.xml) we can almost say with certainty that they liquidated most, if not all of their long positions to cover losses with their short positions. I don't think they reloaded shorts yesterday - I think they are waiting to reload.

All their assumed short positions have run up over the last month, either due to Melvin covering or due to buys from traders making the same play that has been made on GME or a combination of both.

I think one of these scenarios could play out next week,BE CAREFUL:

Official short interest reports release for the end of the month are due for publication from NASDAQ on 2/9 (I am assuming the current reports are not accurate as they are not official). The short interest reports include up to 1/29 and are due for processing on 2/2. IF and ONLY IF they show a LOW short interest, this will trigger a major sell-off in the GME as without the high short interest there is NO MORE upside. I don't think Melvin Capital has given up in this yet, they are not done. Prior to that official data release, I believe they will reload shorts and then cover after the sell-off upon official data release, which is their next attempt to fuck the little guy.
If official short interest is still high, this could be another buy catalyst, but I don't think it will be. Melvin liquidating all its capital shows that they HAD to of covered. There has been so much buying and selling that it would have been less detectable to cover systemically throughout the week.

It depends on how you play this, if you hold you'll still be OK as the price won't drop. Everything points to next week being pretty tame and the 2nd week of February leading to a potential bloodbath. With low short interest on that report most people will have no choice but to sell off.

See below for all of my DD:

Melvin's long positions include the following: (a majority of which were sold off between on Mon. 1/25 and Wed. 1/27 included below are the highs and lows of the week, I am not going to calculate the market caps but you can do it if you want but the MAJOR price action on no news indicates that these were Melvin selling off all or most of their position:

- AMC 37.24%  
- BB 9%  
  
That was just from me randomly searching, I imagine there's a lot more in the 50%+ region. Although obviously I know absolutely nothing about any of this. 

Amcx (amc networks) is a cable TV company (they own BBC America, among others)

They popped up in some ""most shorted stock"" lists early in the GME explosion and I assume a lot of people got confused? Like how the tiny Australian nickel-mining company gme had its stock go from $0.03 to $0.1 overnight.

By all means, throw in on AMC because it's a treasured American company that's in trouble, and it will surely do better after the pandemic, but if you wanna hit the parasitical wall street fuck-knuckles I feel like there are better options.",2021-01-30 10:23:05

Sure AMC is shorted, but not as near as GME.
I really think all other shorted stocks (BB, AMC, BBBY etc) can benefit from all this situation, but to a point.
Plus much more shares of AMC available to cover shorts easily.l, and from what I have seen, on AMC more people have paper hands.
I see AMC go a bit on Monday but not over 19 and then people will start selling for profit again imo.l (down to around 10). Fundamentals are crappy for AMC compared to GME anyway. (Both don't worth their stock price anyway, but this whole market is a one fucking bubble).

Think, why robinhood allow 115 shares of AMC but only 1 of GME? Pretty obvious.

529,"Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats and Republicans, you’ve been duped

Over the last 10 years, we’ve been told our country is getting increasingly divided. For the last 4 years, we’ve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we’ve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. 

The truth is – we’ve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn’t know it.

To the liberals here – how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their “values” to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech’s rush to censor dissent? 

To the conservatives here – you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You’ve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP’s policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. 

We (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We’ve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we’ve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that “the other side” was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. 

This is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. “The man”. Whatever you want to call them. They’ve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They’ve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They’ve been milking you dry. They’ve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can’t even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. 

Jeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That’s $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they’ve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire’s own doomsday bunkers? They don’t have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet’s or their countryside villa’s in southern France. They don’t need you. 

We should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there’s only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. 

I want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We’ve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We’ve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed – of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs – was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. 

So now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. 

The party establishments won’t do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go! 

If you cannot afford Gamestop shares, then get to:

\*Blackberry (BB) – hedge funds are trying to short sell them right now. 

\*AMC 

\*Nokia (NOK)

\*KOSS

Over the last 10 years, we’ve been told our country is getting increasingly divided. For the last 4 years, we’ve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we’ve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. 

The truth is – we’ve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn’t know it.

To the liberals here – how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their “values” to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech’s rush to censor dissent? 

To the conservatives here – you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You’ve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP’s policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. 

We (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We’ve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we’ve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that “the other side” was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. 

This is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. “The man”. Whatever you want to call them. They’ve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They’ve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They’ve been milking you dry. They’ve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can’t even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. 

Jeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That’s $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they’ve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire’s own doomsday bunkers? They don’t have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet’s or their countryside villa’s in southern France. They don’t need you. 

We should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there’s only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. 

I want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We’ve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We’ve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed – of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs – was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. 

So now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. 

The party establishments won’t do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go!

553,"Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats and Republicans, you’ve been duped

Over the last 10 years, we’ve been told our country is getting increasingly divided. For the last 4 years, we’ve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we’ve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. 

The truth is – we’ve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn’t know it.

To the liberals here – how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their “values” to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech’s rush to censor dissent? 

To the conservatives here – you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You’ve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP’s policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. 

We (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We’ve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we’ve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that “the other side” was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. 

This is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. “The man”. Whatever you want to call them. They’ve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They’ve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They’ve been milking you dry. They’ve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can’t even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. 

Jeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That’s $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they’ve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire’s own doomsday bunkers? They don’t have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet’s or their countryside villa’s in southern France. They don’t need you. 

We should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there’s only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. 

I want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We’ve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We’ve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed – of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs – was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. 

So now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. 

The party establishments won’t do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go! 

If you cannot afford Gamestop shares, then get to:

\*Blackberry (BB) – hedge funds are trying to short sell them right now. 

\*AMC 

\*Nokia (NOK)

\*KOSS

\*Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)

\*this is not financial advice, just the ramblings of a retard. Do as you wish\*

There are dozens of others that you can find on the r/WallStreetBets group. It’s time we build our own hedge fund that works for US. 

And who’s to say that we can’t turn Gamestop or Blackberry or AMC theatres around? Who’s to say it’s a “bad stock”. I like the stock. Hell, I even like the companies! We’re the OWNERS now, we can change how things are done. Have our own Reddit WSB Board of Directors, and appoint u/DeepFuckingValue as all-encompassing CEO/Director/COO/etc. at large. Whatever the hell it is these guys do. 

So, look to your left, and look to your right. Give each other a hug. It’s time we moved on from the bickering and divisiveness that has been plaguing this country. We want the same things. It’s time we get our share. 

We want our future back.",2021-01-30 02:52:31

564,"Here is some enlightening information regarding the potential situation at RH.  

But first I want to tip my hat and salute the effort of this WSB group and the balls displayed throughout the week by all its members as seen in the market action.  I spent a long time inside the banks and know how things work there, the bullshit, politics, collusion and yes... its all stacked up against the individual investor.  Myself, and i know a bunch of people who are silently rooting for you guys.  So I simply could no longer stay on the sidelines reading.  I want to help and contribute and shed some light by adding  to the post by ""theaback"" which seems to be correct.

Basically, numnuts CEO from RH should have never gone on TV yesterday.  He was awful and did not really answer the questions directly.  It did not inspire comfort and confidence because we all know someone is pressure him into making restrictions happen.  He did not have the guts to say who.  But every other broker who was questioned has no problem answering.

Earlier today I read an article from Zerohedge.  Here are some excerpts:

""  Something bad is about to go down at Robinhood.

  
One day after the company drew down on its bank lines and obtain a $1 billion rescue capital investment, the company found itself in lockdown mode, allowing just a handful of shares to be bought at a time, effectively shutting down in all but name (it couldn't risk another day of furious public outcry and massive client departures if it blocked trading completely).  


However, just before the close, things got downright surreal when in a blog post the broker - which should probably change its name from Robinhood to Suit - made a shocking announcement: going forward, customers will be subject to maximum aggregate limits in 50 securities of which 14 are capped at position limits of just 5 shares, **while allowing total holdings in 36 securities to be just one share**!

  
In other words, as of this moment, no client is allowed to one more than 1 share in names like GME, AMC, AG, BBBY, BYND, WKHS and many others. **Even boring, low vol names like GM and SBUX are limited to just one share** AAL AMD and even GM are restricted to 1 single share!!!!!

 Panicked clients who are wondering if this means that their current holdings which exceed 1 laughable share will be forcefully liquidated can breathe for now: the company said that ""outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures, **your positions will not be sold for the sole reason that you are currently over the limit.** However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit."" (we expect that to change on Monday, if the company is still around.)

In other words, virtually nobody can buy any *new* securities. The company also disclosed that no fractional shares can be bought going forward as ""fractional shares are currently position closing only for all of the securities listed in the table above. This means you can sell and close your fractional positions, but you can't open new fractional positions. However, you can still open new whole share positions according to the limits listed above."" 

Why is this happening? The most likely reason is that between DTC, clearinghouses and other regulatory entities, Robinhood was found to be in another capital deficiency position - even with the billions raised overnight - and it is being forced to deliver.

  
This likely means that Robinhood is as of this moment, scrambling to obtain even more capital, although we somehow doubt it will be just as easy to ""take from the rich"" as it was late last night especially since the client exodus is surely accelerating.

  
It also means that we may have to have another ""Lehman Weekend"" situation on our hands, only this time it will be a ""Robinhood Weekend"", and an urgent acquisition from a strategic buyer may be required to prevent the worst case outcome. We only hope that the billions in funds held in custody for clients is segregated should the company collapse (pinging Jon Corzine here). 

In any case, expect a lot of Robinhood related news over the weekend. ""

So last time I saw something like this, aka ""a run on the bank"" was in fact Lehman and Bear Stearns in 2008.  They are gone.  Before that it was MF Global and Revco, look it up guys, they are gone as well.  Not only that, the people who had their money there spent a ton of cash on lawyers and it took years to recover a fraction of their capital. 

Hope this helps!!

There is so much universal disgust with Wall Street that the likes of AOC, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. Ro Khanna, Ted Lieu, and Robert Reich all agree that what we saw yesterday is blatant market manipulation.

We need to get the word out that the Short-Sale Rule is already a precedent of regulation by the SEC. If you don’t know what it is, click here: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp

We need to get the word out that the SEC has the power to implement SSR on all our favorite stonks RIGHT NOW. Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and directly contacting your local congressional representatives and senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent continued market manipulation. WSB is not political but both sides of congress are on our side right now and we absolutely cannot let this crucial moment slip to get the justice we deserve after yesterday.

If you do not know who your congressional representative is, click here: https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative

You can use the following when they take your comment:

""I strongly urge congress to call on the executive branch and the SEC to implement and enforce the Short-Sale Rule on heavily shorted stocks to protect retail investors.""

Say whatever else you want, but that is the key phrase that needs to be used. I also mentioned that this is currently charging up a tremendous amount of distrust in American markets that has the potential to devastate our economy on the world stage.

We are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder attacks we’ve been seeing all week.

GET THE FUCKING WORD OUT. I like this stock way too much to not see it grow up and reach its full potential because of billionaire hedge funders strategically unwinding their positions through a series of short ladder attacks instead of letting the squeeze play on as it would in a truly free market.

Feel free to copy/paste this and spread it through the subreddit for all to see.

I'm not saying AMC isn't worth buying (I have 1,000 shares and dozens of calls at varying strike prices & expiration), but this retard is going long on AMCX as well. Calls and shares. I'll see you all in Valhalla.

They have positive EPS, 52-week high of $73, and are currently trading sub-$50. There's 33% upside just to their 52 week high ---- I like this stock! I'll like this stock when its +$100 even more.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.

Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.

835,"DRIED OUT? Bitch I cant buy GME because robinhood restricted my account to now be able to purchase above my 45 shares anymore. By dried out do you mean entirely blocked from buying on the free market?

You think I like sitting here with 6k in buying power not able to buy anymore GME, BB, AMC, and BBBY? No we can't fucking buy when we want to because the market is being RESTRICTED and MANIPULATED. When the SEC and Government step in and tell the FREE MARKET to stop restricting trades we all are buying.

You see how low the volume of trading is today? It's even lower than yesterday because WE CANT BUY, and hedgefunds are just sitting there on their hands trying to algo trade amongst themselves because NO ONE IS SELLING per the volume charts.

We want to buy and we can't and that's not a free market. GME would be at 600 right now without complete shutdown of the free market. They said ""a few people going to prison blocking trades illegally for retail on their platforms is worth more than a 100B+ meltdown of the entire wall street."" And we are still holding and not selling the volume for sales is SO LOW. 

Robinhood basically blocked 80% of the buying power on this sub with their restrictions thinking that would cause a panic sell off and everyone would move on. Instead we didnt sell and the price is rock steady because hedgefunds can't buy from each other anymore they need the retail shares to cover, and we won't budge.",2021-01-29 18:28:57

Alright  everyone listen up. I’m tired of the bullshit, you’re tired of the  bullshit, were all tired of the bullshit, including everyone of the  working class that aren’t even in GME, BB, NOK, BBBY, and AMC. There is  so much universal disgust with Wall Street that the likes of AOC, Ted  Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. Ro Khanna, Ted Lieu, and Robert Reich all agree  that what we saw yesterday is blatant market manipulation.

We  need to get the word out that the Short-Sale Rule is already a  precedent of regulation by the SEC. If you don’t know what it is, click  here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)

We  need to get the word out that the SEC has the power to implement SSR on  all our favorite stonks right now. Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and  directly contacting your local congressional representatives and  senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent  continued market manipulation. WSB is not political but both sides of  congress are on our side right now and we absolutely cannot let this  crucial moment slip to get the justice we deserve after yesterday.

If you do not know who your congressional representative is, click here: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

You can use the following when they take your comment:

**""I  strongly urge congress to call on the executive branch and the SEC to  implement and enforce the Short-Sale Rule on heavily shorted stocks to  protect retail investors.""**

Say  whatever else you want, but that is the key phrase that needs to be  used. I also mentioned that this is currently charging up a tremendous  amount of distrust in American markets that has the potential to  devastate our economy on the world stage.

We  are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and  get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder  attacks we’ve been seeing all week.

GET  THE FUCKING WORD OUT. I like this stock way too much to not see it grow  up and reach its full potential because of billionaire hedge funders  strategically unwinding their positions through a series of short ladder  attacks instead of letting the squeeze play on as it would in a truly  free market.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀I'm holding just under 150K shares of MAC with my 💎✋. I've been holding since roughly $9.00/share (it's around $19 now), to give you an idea of how much confidence I have in it. I'm already up over $1M -- but I'm expecting much more!

It’s down a bit today since the short sellers are attacking this just like they are attacking GME, BBBY, BB, AMC, So, today’s a great time to buy. Not only is it a great underpriced company, but it will also add more pressure to the fight against these short sellers who are shorting all the same stocks you love too (notice the retail theme!)

I've done a \*ton\* of DD on this company along with a friend. Reviewed every quarterly report, earnings call ... been going to their malls in a number of states, etc ... If there's more interest here, I can put some time together to put a much longer post with a lot of DD.

First off, if you are thinking ""Retail is dead"" ... These aren’t the lame mall you go with your wife to, these are the nice ones your wife’s boyfriend takes her to.

The summary of all my DD is: The company was underpriced before covid, because ""Retail is dead"", and 🏳️‍🌈🐻 short sellers were pricing it for bankruptcy. In reality: The malls are busy, and the banks have no interest in foreclosing since the loans are non-recourse. Revenue per square foot is already at 90% of pre-covid levels, occupancy is at 94%, and any vacancies that opened up were quickly replaced. The dividend will almost certainly be recovered to normal (4X current levels) within the next year or two, which gives it one of the best dividends available in the market today.

There is 70% short interest, 93% is held by institutions and 7% by insiders. Put in other words, when a squeeze happens, there are basically no available shares.

I don't know about GME, and I wish you guys luck on that -- I haven't done DD on it -- but I can tell you that MAC should be worth at least $40-60/share in a year, and even $100-150 is a very reasonable valuation based purely on fundamentals. The market will certainly figure this out in the next few quarters, as the dividend gets increased. But, given the possibility of a monstrous short squeeze, this could easily pop MUCH higher than $150 in the short term.

Of course, you should do your own DD, this is just my opinion, and it isn't advice. I just like the stock.

There is so much universal disgust with Wall Street that the likes of AOC, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. Ro Khanna, Ted Lieu, and Robert Reich all agree that what we saw yesterday is blatant market manipulation.

We need to get the word out that the SEC has the power to implement SSR on all our favorite stonks RIGHT NOW. Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and directly contacting your local congressional representatives and senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent continued market manipulation.

We are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder attacks we’ve been seeing all week.

Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and directly contacting your local congressional representatives and senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent continued market manipulation. WSB is not political but both sides of congress are on our side right now and we absolutely cannot let this crucial moment slip to get the justice we deserve after yesterday.

If you do not know who your congressional representative is, click here: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

We are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder attacks we’ve been seeing all week.

GET THE FUCKING WORD OUT. I like this stock way too much to not see it grow up and reach its full potential because of billionaire hedge funders strategically unwinding their positions through a series of short ladder attacks instead of letting the squeeze play on as it would in a truly free market.

Make sure that you have sell orders on this warstonk! Once it passes beyound the aquila rift, they will call us nazis and drop fake news again. An then they gonna do other shit to keep us away from the market. 

Worst case is that you wont be able to do shit AGAIN cuz RH (and others) is going out of order.

1203,"Adding this for my records , wrote the SEC earlier as follows:

""Hello,

This is a formal complaint on the brokerage Robinhood, although it's knows that many other brokerages are doing the same action. Market manipulation is a type of market abuse where there is a deliberate attempt to interfere with the free and fair operation of the market. Robinhood halted the purchase of several securities due to ""ongoing volatility"" yet is currently allowing positions to be closed on these securities. Three known are AMC , GME , BB , and BBBY. 

I'd like to request a formal investigation into their practices. Specifically a review of prior securities which experienced similar or identical market volatility yet did not become ""position-closing only"".

If there is found to be similar swings in volatility without a cessation to opening positions then it can be determined that what Robinhood is currently engaged in is not a free market action but a manipulation of a market security. This case should be opened, fully investigated, and communication which may or may not have influenced their decision discovered. 

When a brokerage is opened it contracts to follow the law set; not to change the availability of certain stocks due to potential pressure. This pressure this time may be from hedge funds using a guise of volatility to cover their ass-ets. 

The SEC has an obligation to the law. Millions if not more users are being damaged currently due to an inability to purchase securities deemed a danger to business as usual for Wallstreet hedge funds. Please do the correct thing and allow a free and fair market to continue otherwise the iniquity of the system will become apparent and unfixable. 

And if there becomes knowledge of manipulation , cessation of trading not due to volatility , influence by certain hedge funds afraid to lose big , or any factor which has damaged the retail investors ability to participate in free markets , please proceed to the full extent of your ability to prosecute. 

This is for those who are unable to have influence alone and need the system to work correctly or it becomes another example of a rigged system.

Either all the brokerages halting purchases but not sales made identical decisions at identical times in a coincidence or a coordinated move against retail investors. 

Thank you, please look into this""",2021-01-29 06:10:31

""Traders who gobbled up GameStop ([GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME)) stock in the [Reddit-user-fueled push](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/what-is-wall-street-bets-the-upstart-reddit-group-that-is-pummeling-wall-street-162734056.html) to squeeze short sellers could end up on the defending side of enforcement action if officials can find out who they are and show they tried to manipulate or deceive the markets.

Indeed, Fox Business Network’s Charlie Gasparino [tweeted on Thursday ](https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1354859765491494912)that regulatory sources were telling him they would be looking at a market manipulation case related to GameStop trading.

However, a successful case against those who caused the spikes is no slam dunk. That’s partly because it could be hard for regulators to show that traders intentionally deceived market participants into thinking that GameStop’s fundamentals were healthier than they actually were.

“GameStop is super weird, because at least at this point it’s all over the news. People kind of know that this strange and artificial thing is happening — that the company's price is much higher than its fundamentals,” University of Michigan School of Law assistant professor, [Gabriel Rauterberg](https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=rauterb), told Yahoo Finance, noting that it could be tough for regulators to show the traders, whose efforts appear to have been out in the open, sent false price signals. Regulators may have more success targeting the buying behavior that took place at the very beginning of the effort, he said.

Those traders [pushed GameStop’s stock price](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?p=GME) from $96.73 a share at the market open on Monday to $347.51 at the market close on Wednesday, prompting the New York Stock Exchange to halt trading multiple times. On Thursday, the popular trading platform Robinhood [halted buying of the stock](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhood-bars-users-from-buying-game-stop-stock-infuriating-its-users-144007484.html), along with other hot stocks including AMC ([AMC](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMC)), BlackBerry ([BB](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BB)), Bed Bath and Beyond ([BBBY](http://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BBBY)). GameStop stock was down 27% just after 1:30 p.m. EST on Thursday.

These stocks, which short sellers have bet against, have shot up wildly in recent days as day traders, particularly those on the Reddit group WallStreetBets, have dove headlong into the stocks. That buying frenzy, in turn, has spurred short sellers to buy the stock to cover their losses — driving up prices even more. Can the traders behind this short squeeze be accused of market manipulation?

“What matters the most, legally, is what can be proven about the intent of the trader when he or she placed the order,” futures and securities litigation attorney [Andrew Lourie](https://kobrekim.com/people/andrew-c-lourie), who specializes in disputes alleging market manipulation, told Yahoo Finance.

## ‘Always potential’ for legal action

Traders who knowingly worked in concert to purchase the stock for reasons aside from its market fundamentals could face legal action from regulators, according to Lourie. That action would most likely be a civil suit from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), due to a [vaguely worded statute](https://casetext.com/statute/united-states-code/title-15-commerce-and-trade/chapter-2b-securities-exchanges/section-78j-manipulative-and-deceptive-devices) that gives it wide latitude to file litigation over market scenarios they view as undesirable.

“When it comes to manipulation there's always potential \[for legal action\] merely because there's no clear statutory definition for manipulation, especially with futures,” Lourie said. “The definition is largely case-law created, and can evolve in response to new interpretations regulators ask the court to adopt, via an enforcement action.”

The Securities Exchange Act prohibits very [specific kinds of conduct](https://www.govregs.com/uscode/15/78i), and otherwise relies on general fraud provisions, which prohibit using a “fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative device,” Lourie noted.

## Manipulation law is ‘always a mess’

[Rauterberg](https://www.law.umich.edu/FacultyBio/Pages/FacultyBio.aspx?FacID=rauterb), of the University of Michigan Law School, said he wouldn’t be surprised if the SEC sued GameStop traders, based on the agency’s affinity for high-profile cases and aggressive pursuit of market manipulation. But it could be tough to prove the case.

For one, GameStop’s stock volatility, in his view, doesn’t appear to involve securities fraud, which means regulators would rely on case law that poorly defines market manipulation and deception.

“The really striking thing about manipulation law is that 85 years after the securities laws were adopted, the federal courts still disagree about what it means. So manipulation law is always a mess,” Rauterberg said.

Under the law, one way regulators can attack what they deem to be a “manipulative device” is by proving a group of people agreed to take collective action to buy, sell, or otherwise contract for a stock based on motivation unrelated to a company’s fundamentals — in essence, buying or selling collectively in order to move price, rather than based solely on perceived market value, or speculation as to future value.

That claim could unravel, though, because GameStop traders’ appear to have acted openly, Rauterberg said.

## SEC reviewing GameStop activities, working with fellow regulators

Investors pressed to cover short positions have argued that [Reddit group](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5xpai/the_gme_thread_for_january_27_2020/) participants artificially drove up the price of GameStop’s stock. Reddit participants, on the other hand, have argued that their tactics were fair game, and merely took advantage of greedy Wall Street players who first exploited the system by over-shorting the stock to artificially drive down the company’s stock price.

SEC officials, for their part, issued a joint statement Wednesday noting that they were “[monitoring the ongoing market volatility](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/joint-statement-ongoing-market-volatility-2021-01-27),” though they did not mention GameStop by name.

In addition to making their legal arguments, regulators would first need to identify the relevant purchasers and connect them to the trades — which could be challenging. The hurdles shouldn’t be expected to stop the SEC from trying, the legal experts said.

“Once you get into these unusual price spikes, like you have with GameStop,” Lourie said, “you're going to draw the attention of the regulators.”""",2021-01-28 19:46:55

Under the law, one way regulators can attack what they deem to be a “manipulative device” is by proving a group of people agreed to take collective action to buy, sell, or otherwise contract for a stock based on motivation unrelated to a company’s fundamentals — in essence, buying or selling collectively in order to move price, rather than based solely on perceived market value, or speculation as to future value.
That claim could unravel, though, because GameStop traders’ appear to have acted openly, Rauterberg said.

SEC reviewing GameStop activities, working with fellow regulators

Investors pressed to cover short positions have argued that Reddit group participants artificially drove up the price of GameStop’s stock. Reddit participants, on the other hand, have argued that their tactics were fair game, and merely took advantage of greedy Wall Street players who first exploited the system by over-shorting the stock to artificially drive down the company’s stock price.
SEC officials, for their part, issued a joint statement Wednesday noting that they were “monitoring the ongoing market volatility,” though they did not mention GameStop by name.
In addition to making their legal arguments, regulators would first need to identify the relevant purchasers and connect them to the trades — which could be challenging. The hurdles shouldn’t be expected to stop the SEC from trying, the legal experts said.
“Once you get into these unusual price spikes, like you have with GameStop,” Lourie said, “you're going to draw the attention of the regulators.”",2021-01-28 19:45:05

Melvin Capital Management is a hedge fund company. They had a ton of shorts on GME so that they could drive the price down and snatch up the shares at a heavy profit. Now WSB (a group on Reddit) got tired of hedge funds like this constantly making a ton of money off the backs of small companies so they decided to drive the price up to a ridiculous level and basically drive Melvin CM into bankruptcy.

Now, here's where it gets sketchy (illegal af, whatever). Melvin was going under so Citadel (another hedge fund) came in and bailed them out to the sum of 2.7 billion dollars 2 days ago. Now that didn't slow buyers down at all. If anything, it spurred them on.

Citadel just so happens to be the brokerage firm behind Robinhood. When RH realized they couldn't slow down buyers by having constant ""app issues"" they decided to make it so that users can't buy GME, BB, BBBY, AMC etc and they can only sell. Basically Citadel is trying to make everyone sell out before all of those shares that Melvin has to cover come due on Tuesday because they won't have the funds to cover it.

## UPDATE: GameStop and AMC trading restricted by TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Robinhood others

10:40 am ET January 28, 2021 (MarketWatch) Print

By Mark DeCambre

'We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only,' said Interactive Brokers on Thursday

Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of certain companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors inspired by social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905)(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), along with other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. ""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors.""

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but operates it as an independent retail brokerage, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those stocks, including [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905).

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, limiting how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""

On Thursday, Interactive Brokers Group ([https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interactivebrokers.com%2F&esheet=52369556&newsitemid=20210128005689&lan=en-US&anchor=Interactive+Brokers+Group&index=1&md5=8e527dd84e4d46012dbb5ce2a08ad471)(IBKR](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interactivebrokers.com%2F&amp;esheet=52369556&amp;newsitemid=20210128005689&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Interactive+Brokers+Group&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8e527dd84e4d46012dbb5ce2a08ad471)(IBKR)) announced that as of midday Wednesday ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005689/en/Interactive-Brokers-Takes-Action-on-Actively-Traded-Symbols](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005689/en/Interactive-Brokers-Takes-Action-on-Actively-Traded-Symbols)), it put [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905), AMC, BlackBerry Limited (BB.T) , retailer Express Ltd.(EXPR), and [Koss Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=179137).(KOSS) option trading into liquidation only due to the extraordinary volatility in the markets. Meaning investors could only unwind their positions, not create new ones.

""In addition, long stock positions will require 100% margin and short stock positions will require 300% margin until further notice,"" the brokerage said.

""We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may add or remove symbols as may be warranted.""

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathering in online chat forums have gone on to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms including Robinhood (which in its initial conception was meant to be a social platform organized around the trading of stocks), have clashed with hedge-fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905) shares.

See:Your guide to the lingo on the Reddit forum fueling [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905)'s rise and over half of working mothers say their job performance has slipped during the pandemic ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-guide-to-the-lingo-on-the-reddit-forum-fueling-gamestops-rise-and-over-half-of-working-mothers-say-their-job-performance-has-slipped-during-the-pandemic-2021-01-27?mod=mw\_more\_headlines](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/your-guide-to-the-lingo-on-the-reddit-forum-fueling-gamestops-rise-and-over-half-of-working-mothers-say-their-job-performance-has-slipped-during-the-pandemic-2021-01-27?mod=mw_more_headlines))

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905) and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905), and AMC Entertainment, has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and retailer Express Inc. rocketing on Wednesday.

News alert:Outsized stock-market movers: AMC, up 225%; Express, up 140%; [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905), up 88% ([https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/multi?tickers=gme,amc,expr,spx,comp,djia](https://www.marketwatch.com/tools/multi?tickers=gme,amc,expr,spx,comp,djia))

Recent volatile trade has made some on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a rapidly inflating bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, Massachusetts's secretary of the commonwealth, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=mktw](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=mktw)) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

That they're sudden rise today of 200-300% was orchestrated by the short sellers to draw attention to them because they believe Millenials have such a short attention span that they can't focus on something for more than 5 minutes. 

They spent a few hundred million to pump up those stocks during the pre market, sent their paid army of redditors to say, ""Hey guys, how about that AMC?"" and then let it ride for the day, only to pull a coordinated sell after hours and dump GME, BB, AMC, BBBY, NOK, EXPR etc. all at the same time. Get people to panic and think, ""I should sell my GME so I'm still in the green for the day.""

Did you read the articles today saying ""Look at the reddit short squeezers bumping up the price of AMC, NOK etc."" THERE IS NO SHORT SQUEEZE ANYWHERE BUT GME.  The other cheap stocks that happen to have a relatively high short interest are not squeezable at all.

Stonk man breaking all rules now, make me look dumb. I tell you, stonk man will be caveman like me soon he continue act this way. Hope you help me teach stonk man lesson,  hold your stonk. 



I don't have a lot of money, but like many people here, I have nothing to lose. The whole upper class is waging war against us, and if got even a fraction of what had been given to this big institutions as stimulus, maybe we would have a better economy. I like Gamestop. I just went in before this all went down and picked up a couple games for my ps3 ( I haven't bought anything new gaming-wise since 2012, you know because poor) but I sold 40 ounces of silver to cover my positions here, with the hope I may be able to get a 3% down payment on a house. Working 40 hours a week, I like most of you live paycheck to paycheck. 

We are like the Micheal Scott Paper Company. You can shut us down but we will just keep coming back over and over. We can sustain this longer than any hedge fund can remain solvent.  There are millions of us who will join our cause now that this is on the news, and your coverage will backfire. I'm only 27, and I gained an interest in trading and supporting companies I love via the stock market. I've shared this with my friends, who have all now vested interest and we get on zoom calls and talk about stocks and learn. Younger generations will join the market and destroy the older generations living off of market manipulation. Your time is over. I hope you enjoyed your stay. My generation is beginning to run for office, and it's been made clear to us for the last 20 years that you are unscrupulous as they come. 

To which I say, we are on the dawn of a new era of investing, one where WE CAN SET THE TONE FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. Be vocal and don't let these people spin it how they want it. We are not criminals or children,  they are. Talk to your family, get them interested in stocks and tell them that *that* is what matters. Supporting companies we love. Not their margin, not their indicators or returns... Support companies that give you what you want when you use them. I plan to expand my shares to cover products I use everyday and do my due diligence. You should take this time to consider other products you enjoy, and possibly send a share their way after you the final squeeze of gamestop, and the likely crash of the entire stock market as it exists today.  Cheers, and diamond hands to what you love. Seriously though the only reason not to buy GME right now is if you are sitting on unsettled funds and can't immediately get out of your stuff, like me. That or you just don't have $250 give work take laying around to hope it drops tomorrow to pick one up. I'm sure things will happen but seriously guys, trading is hard as fuck. Take this all you can eat buffet  on GME while you still can. The getting is good. My other investments are garbage right now, but I'm stuck holding them until my time lock ends. Or face a good faith violation.

I am writing this to the newer “traders” in hopes that your new found investment money can be put to good use. For those that have cashed in earnings, on GME, BB, BBBY, AMC, etc good for you!

I want to first start off saying – this is NOT normal trade behavior. Do NOT think for a second this is normal and this can continue. 

I do agree with the masses here that ANY stock can be bought for ANY reason. Period. The valuation of an entity is only in the eyes of the investor. That investor is afforded the opportunity to be right or wrong.

Your exit point should already be determined PRIOR TO ENTERING A POSITON.  Stop asking when you should exit, chart your own success.

There are a few things here I hope you gain from this. Normal investing vs huge momentum investing. What is going on here is not fundamental investing, it is pure momentum investing. Nothing wrong with that. If Warren buffet buys 500,000 shares, the price will go up. Buffet might not sell, but you can bet your basement butts that hedgefunds drive prices up and sell once momentum is picked up on. That is what is happening here.

GME is NOT worth $350 a share – but that is OK. Tesla, Snowflake, Beyond meat and many other companies have stock values that exceed what the company is truly worth from a fundamental analysis point of view.

The “true” value of a stock used to be derived from “PE Rations”. This in essence was that a stock was worth X multipler in accordance to the profit it produced per share. The typical PE ration was considered expensive at 10ish. Now we have MANY stocks that are considered “good companies” selling for 40-100 their PE ratio. Stupid in my opinion, but again each investor can do as he pleases.

There are many ways to invest in a “non herd” mentality. Many of you are herd mentality and will lose your basement dwelling butts if you do not understand how “normal” markets work.

I encourage each and every one of you to start looking into how trading truly works and how risk management is assessed. Each stock type also has it risk. GME, AMC, BB are all HIGH RISK stocks where no one in their right mind would YOLO into it on a normal day.

There are many ways of looking at a stock for profitability, technical analysis, speculative analysis (bio medical stocks) and fundamental analysis. None of them are “THE” right way, but are ways that you can actually maintain a good 15-25% profits each year if you understand that and risk analysis.

I see a lot of talk about options as well. Options can be very profitable but you must understand the components of options. You need to understand the “greeks” and how they can work for you or against you. Investing into options because you get “leverage” is a fools way to becoming mom’s permanent meat loaf taste tester.

Momentum trading – which is happening here is PERFECTLY acceptable, spite what CNBC, etc are saying. Hedge Funds and investors do it around the world ALL. THE. TIME. 

It is NOT investing though. It is speculative – ride the wave mentality. Which works, and sometimes it doesn’t.

If you want to start learning, study 1 – 3 stocks and understand their movement. I trade DIA – the DOW ETF a lot. I understand the moves and where the “floors and ceilings” are. This way I know when I have an opportunity, or when I should wait.

I am not going to tell you to sell your shares of whatever you have – but I will tell you this. Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. If you are up big, cashing SOMETHING out is advisable. This is part of risk management. You take a little bit as your gains increase. This way you always have money and hopefully don’t blow up your account .

I would also say you should start with no more than 3-5k which will make you really have to learn. If you start with too much you risk making dumb decisions (especially after a coupe wins).

Best of luck – nothing truly goes to the moon – but it can be life changing!

TLDR: Go back and read it – you should",2021-01-28 01:17:35

2414,"UPDATE: GameStop, AMC trading is now being restricted at TD Ameritrade, Schwab
4:09 pm ET January 27, 2021 (MarketWatch)

By Mark DeCambre

Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors on social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" she said.

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but is still operating as an independent retail brokerage platform, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those trading names, including GameStop.

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, or how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathered in online chat forums to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms like Robinhood, have clashed with hedge-fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop shares.

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the popular trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for GME and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertainment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc. (EXPR). whose shares were up 250%.

The recent volatile trade has even made some on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

2667,"😡😡😡😡MW UPDATE: GameStop, AMC trading is now being restricted at TD Ameritrade

By Mark DeCambre

At least one major retail-focused brokerage house is starting to respond to a frenetic surge in shares of companies that have been attributed to rabid buying by mom-and-pop investors on social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the value of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" the spokeswoman said.

The moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January as traders have been gathering on online chat forums and taking large bets on the stock using options--often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Fanatics on sites lilke Reddit's WallStreetBets have clashing with hedge fund investors and have been casting the clashes been prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop as a battle between deep-pocketed traditional investors and average folk.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop is spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertaintment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc. (EXPR). whose shares were up 220%.

The recent bubblicious trade has apparently made many on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

Plus, if these squeezes don't take off until AFTER GME is sqouze, then most of us will be able to put WAY more money into the new squeezes than we could ever afford for GME.

So there has been a huge effort on the behalf of the shorts to mislead everyone. There idea is to misdirect. They said they got out of their short positions but the float is STILL 138.4% and the stock only got to 365 in AH where it's easy to manipulate price. For reference, AMC is 36.58%, Telsa is 8%.

GME is 138.4% they doubled down and are trying everyway to distract you to other stocks. My guess would be they are the ones pumping up AMC because they know most Robinhood users can do anything unless they sell their GME positions. They NEED your shares to get out of this jam. If you sell, you give them the ammo to do it. People are asking is the squeeze over? The squeeze didn't even start yet by the look of it.

They want you to run over to some other short positions. They figure if all of us take profits today they will accumulate enough shares to tank it and shake out the weak paper hands giving them more ammo.

If you hold and don't touch your commons. You will be part of the largest squeeze and transfer of wealth in history. The fed caused this by this extra liquidity which allowed greed to run rampant. This isn't our fault they double down and never took profits. The greed that was allowed on their behalf was insane here. 138.4% short. This is life changing money for many of us. Myself included. I could pay off debt, student loans, have money for my kids college.

Diamond hands. Buy every dip.

They are trying to distract you with AMC, BB, BBBY. Telling you the squeeze is over when they actually doubled down. They think we are idiots, let's show them how smart it is to double down against people with very little to lose in comparison to them. Don't worry, they will just get a government bail out and do it again. This is our time people.

3364,go BBBY gooo!!!!,2021-01-22 20:26:48
3365,"You new?BB has and continues to get mentioned for the last year.

So has GME.

&#x200B;

I've seen MT and VALE mentioned

ELY,

CRSR,

BBBY,

TSLA,

NIO,

PLTR,

&#x200B;

Just because you got a hard on for GME doesn't mean others shouldn't be able to post what they'd like. Now AMC on the other hand, super cautious about and think it's absolutely a pump.

&#x200B;

Everyone of the above has a legit play at hand including BB. BB actually may outperform GME in the upcoming years.

&#x200B;

3382,"Yes there is, but the value of the company is dependent on their ERs this year. They are a turn around story, and if the ERs support it, it's going up. The price surges the last two weeks are from shorts that shorted both GME and BBBY blowing up and having to cover, mixed with a BBBY gamma squeeze on high volumes of options.

If it keeps getting more attention the price will likely stabilize and go up further over time (or if any more shorts are forced to cover).

I had some LEAPS and other contracts looking for this to hit $30-35 some time between April and August. I've sold all of them after the squeeze today to lock in some profits. If it looks stable next week I might enter some LEAPS again.",2021-01-22 19:47:34

BB is the safe long term hold. I wouldn't even consider it a meme if it didn't have so much exposure here.

3833,"u/deepfuckingvalue was one of the first people to really look at GME, he saw beyond the potential for a short squeeze and believed in the GME making the turn around. The man’s been holding GME for **MORE THAN A YEAR**. Seriously, go through his posts and admire the progression, and then laugh at all the haters who doubted him in the comments.


>what’s the next one brewing after GME?

Haha that’s what everyone wants to know but that’s what makes GME so special. There has never been another stock that’s been this heavily shorted in history. VW comes at a distant second. 

Other folks around here are trying to squeeze Bed Bath and Beyond ($BBBY) but they are not nearly as heavily shorted as GME. 

In terms of my own DD, I just kinda scour the web for whatever info I can find. u/deepfuckingvalue ‘s YouTube persona —Roaring Kitty, has a video on the tools he uses for finding stocks. I haven’t watched it personally, but I figure it’s a good place to start if value investing is something you’re interested in.


&nbsp;

MarketBeat isn’t bad. MarketWatch is also good for info, I use their IPO calendar to track companies looking to go public. Barron’s is okay. CNBC is okay.

But, there’s a chance the market could just keep melting up for the rest of the year, impossible to time the crash, but it’ll happen.

AMD - Unless youre getting calls 4+ months out, it can remain flat for a while and for all that, there are other plays to make in the meantime. It's good to have in the portfolio as a hold though.

BBBY - Great for a covid recovery, possible short squeeze, and WSB herd mentality pump. I'd get it as well.

We could potentially be done for market manipulation, but no more than any of the investment firms changing their recommendations from buy to sell, or Cramer advising to avoid or buy certain stocks.

4077,"Yeah, too many people now being oh this stock is cool all in and hope people say sure. GME fundamentally changed with RC and it is positioned well. This isn't just a meme, GME is a play and we caught a short overextended during the play which has increased the potential for a big bag. It isn't some oh Comcast is going to kill earnings let's go all in. First of all, Comcast can suck deez nuts. Second of all, there is no play and no short. Comcast has it's territory and charges its rates, it's like a utility stock.  GME has been a developing play over a month at least and we noticed Melvin thought playtime was over but it was just getting started. 

But we need to be extremely vigilant and aware of spam bots. Too many people hoping their stock gets memed next and they get the 10 bagger. Especially watch out for BB vs BBY vs BBBY because I have already noticed a lot of people buying one of these three thinking it is another. GM is clearly not GME but people are buying bestbuy and saying all aboard BB town and realizing that it has nothing to do with blackberry.",2021-01-16 08:54:03

4095,"They are trading on a different time frame than us. Melvin in particular has had a short position on $GME since 2015. They are in it for the long haul and similar to BBBY, none of these institutional shorts should be scrambling for the door just yet.

RC still needs to turn it around in their eyes. Icahn failed to turn Blockbuster around, all they see here is a less proven activist who hasn't even shared a definitive game plan other than ""you have 55 million PowerUp members"". And ""you should sell used games online"".

No one knows for certain how he'll reap positive cash flow out of those avenues and if he'll succeed.

We're but a blip on the radar of their time horizon right now.

That said, I think the heavy buying this week was driven by other institutional money getting on board behind RC and they don't care who is short. As much as some WSBers want to think all of wall street is in cohoots, the fact of the matter is most of the time they will happily eat each others lunch when they find someone fucked up.

4277,"they have about 1.4B cash on hand:

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BBBY/bed-bath-beyond/balance-sheet?freq=Q

which has been increasing since 2017

regarding the debt, if they issued it, and it was bought, it can be interpreted as a positive sign for the company as it indicates the buyer(s) and BBBY believe they'll be able to pay that debt back

there's been a good shakeup of management as well in 2019. the CEO hails from top positions at Target and Nordstrom

the future of the company is debatable, but purely speculative. also, all things considered, they've done well considering the impacts of the pandemic. given the increasing trend of wfh, it's likely that the demand for home decoration, design, and improvement will also continue to reap benefits for companies like BBBY

does that mean the stock should (or would) go to $2000 though? no one can predict that",2021-01-15 12:55:21

4286,They took on 150m of debt to buy back equity. That makes it intrinsically more risky due to a higher chance of bankruptcy now. That’s not really a catalyst if anything that would be a reason of concern to me with bbby having decreasing cash flows.,2021-01-15 12:28:15
4287,I see a lot of comments talking about other squeezes but people need to understand that just because a stock is heavily shorted doesn’t mean it will squeeze. Gme had a huge catalyst with Cohen taking a big stake in the company and being put on the board with other chewy members. Other companies don’t have that luxury and they will continue to just tank. It makes sense to hop on the gme squeeze but bbby doesn’t make sense to me. there’s no catalyst that will make it really squeeze in my opinion.,2021-01-15 12:24:56

can you help me understand why you're so bullish on corsair's q3 earnings?

And I bring this up for comparison - the beauty and home goods segment of LB had amazing comps for same store sales in 2020.  That means that women are flocking to the stores and buying like mad.

5714,"Hey guys, BBBY earnings are this week and boy howdy could this one be live.

It’s the 4th highest short percentage of all companies worth over 1billion.

If the conditions are right we could see a pretty significant squeeze, and the catalyst for this would be very strong earnings and guidance.

I don’t want to type something huge up but if you do the research yourself I think you’ll agree that given Tritons past results already this year, and how effectively they handled this holiday season, it’s a good bet he’s positioned the company well going into earnings.

Estimates have been revised upward 10% the past month for earnings, and the average PT from analysts is 24$

In the event that they beat earnings and show strong guidance, I expect to see the stock surge not only as a result of earnings, but to climb even more because of the large number of short positions which will begin to cover as a result.

This is simply my personal prediction. Good luck everyone.

5802,"As long as the recovery story stays intact, the stock will march towards the October highs. I loved what the company is doing so far: divesting the excess and focusing on improving core businesses. Right now they're financially engineering EPS growth for future quarters via buybacks so I'd expect the stock to go up, all else equal. Company clearly won't go bankrupt as they have a net cash position now (iirc) so shorting doesn't make sense unless one believes it's criminally overvalued (it's not) or poorly run (it's not).

Ultimately, leadership still has to execute the turnaround operationally which will take some time, and we don't know how much covid contributed to BBBY sales. If they can maintain/steal market share while streamlining costs and improving the customer's online experience, I don't see how the stock doesn't go up.

That said, I think this is more of a long term play. I think they'll do fine this quarter but that doesn't mean shorts have to cover — and just because there is high short interest doesn't mean the stock has to squeeze.

Her caramel-brown heavenly silky mane grazes the bathsuds, as she arches her back setting her perfectly pedicured toes on a royal-purple sued pillow. The Jacuzzi room smells of pink grapefruit cigars, lavender, newborn babies, newspaper and sex. It smells exactly like winning. 

The candles dance, flutter and swoon at her every move. With graceful damp diamond hands, she opens some WSB fan-mail. A quick flick of the wrist with her platinum dagger, the envelope is rendered useless as another one-liner falls tubside. ""Dear Kit-Cat, I wood 😉.... just give me a break"". She laughs gently as if she hasn't read twelve slight variations earlier this same evening.  In the blink of any eye, she crumples the paper neatly into a paper helicopter and flies it directly onto the over-flowing waste-basket. 

Her left-hand reaches for her laptop and wakes it by swiftly drawing two and a half identical perfect circles on the touchpad. She knows she is halfway to loading her Bed Bath and Beyond shopping cart with bathbombs, creamy lotions dreamy potions and other stuff they sell, 'to the tits' she thinks. 

She soaks in her meticulously refinished antique jacuzzi tub with a warm smile and ever-compassionate eyes glowing in the laptop light. A pop up tweet interrupts her tranquility. 

'I beat the market just like Cathy has, but you don't see teenaged boys lined-up and screaming in the street for Todd Notsobad do ya!' Her gentle smile holds strong, 'A monkey can beat the market my poor Todd', her fingertips glide through her slippery silk am she adjusts her glasses, 'try looking perfect while doing it and then we'll talk' she giggles for what seems like an awkwardly long time. 

Pressing the champagne glass tightly to her lips, she deeply inhales the bubbles before, in a single effortless gulp, she downs the entirety.  Quickly she fills her cart and without a twitch from her perfectly proportioned lushest of eye-lashes, she punches in her order information with the speed of a woodpecker, yet the precision of a surgeon.  'Submit Order' she clicks. 

Completely satisfied with the online customer experience, she looks herself in the eye and with the confidence of a true goddess living among Neanderthals, she says; 'Well Kit-Cat, to you and 2021 also aging extremely well, Cheers!'

Then she looks at you, the creepy peeper, and instantly she sees your inner scared little boy living behind cheap vinyl blinds and she beams a infectious smile at that lost little boy.  She sits up, and fixes her glasses without breaking eye-contact she says, ""Happy New Year WSB!  May your tendies be on time and crispy, and may you all eventually learn to buy the dip, and not the tip. Now make like a good little boy and get the fuck off my property!""

Bed Bath and Beyond is looking ripe for a squeeze, massive short interest, company sitting on a cash reserve, just bought back shares which has depleted the pool.

6050,"To edit the post or not, the struggle is real fml. Ok i wont, fuck you.

Yeah they are not changing the products of their core stores right now afaik (the BBBY ones), but they had a lot of shitty assets dragging on the profitability as a whole.  They want to concentrate on the beauty and baby aspects of the company.

For a quick review: in early 2020 BBBY consisted of a bunch of shit noone who hasnt red their SEC files or similar knew of: 

Bed Bath & Beyond (""BBB"") (the shop everyone knows, **AND:** Christmas Tree Shops, Christmas Tree Shops andThat! or andThat! (collectively, ""CTS""), Harmon, Harmon Face Values, or Face Values (collectively, ""Harmon""), buybuy BABY (""Baby"") and World Market, Cost Plus World Market, or Cost Plus (collectively, ""Cost Plus World Market"") and they operated One Kings Lane and personalizationmall.com. They also had more stuff that was not subject to reportings like Linen Holdings.

They managed to sell One Kings Lane in April and [PersonalizationMall.com](https://PersonalizationMall.com) in August, plus Christmas tree shops and institutional Linen Holdings business and a distribution center for a great price in early Q4 (reflected in earnings when the sales value is different from the book value), and in december (not included in the Q4 tho) they sold cost plus world market. 

All these Assets were seen as quite bad by analysts and were dragging on the core value of BBBY, and as far as i can tell BBBY got a better price than expected for their sales (sadly i could not find out the book value for the assets).

According to tritton they have ""meaningfully reduced our lease liability and overall dept"" trough these sales. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So, while you won't notice a difference when you walk into a BBBY shop, they have -as far as i can tell- significantly improved their position trough these sales and streamlining operations, and trough the incredible rise of their new online shop and distribution.",2020-12-29 00:22:03

Even if a stock is ridiculously shorted like GME, you still need a strong catalyst for the squeeze to take place.  It doesn't just happen on it's own.  So if GME came out and said they were changing their business model to some new highly profitable strategy, then yeah, you'll probably get a squeeze.  Short of that though, I doubt it.

And weeks later as expected, GME is back to a new 52-week high. And it's still only a 1 billion market cap company with around 7 billion in revenues. Compare that to other retailers like JWN, BBBY and BBY. I'm just hoping the CRSR profit takers start moving into GME now when they realize CRSR is at a 3 billion market cap with only 1 billion in revenues, then see the obvious opportunity in GME as a value pick with actual growth prospects in the 3 year outlook (so it's not just a value trap)

I wish we could coordinate as a community to do almost like denial of service attacks where we buy a large portion of heavily a heavily shorted stock and then manipulate the fuck out of the price by running up the ask price and refusing to budge.

JWN is a bit more shaky.  M cant seem to break out of 7.50 to the upside  but finds support ~upper 5's.  They've got great online fulfillment though - my dad buys stuff from them all the time, free shipping, easy web site (made easy for boomer eyes on tablets with giant photos and buttons), and it comes quick in the mail.

6768,"Depends what day. My strategy is usually check next week's ERs and plan accordingly. I like to buy about 4-6 week expiry options and predict a direction. This week's is HPQ; I bought puts last week hoping it'll crash after ER. I made a killing shorting BBBY (bed bath, not best buy), WYNN/MGM, etc. 

Some days I just pick SPY direction. Some days I buy puts on TSLA then laugh at my loss before exiting prior to EOD. Basic day-trade scalping, but I can't do this too frequently due to PDT rules. I'm unrestricted in TDA but I tend to trade safer there since it's ""real"" money in my 401k (which is up like +100% since the covid-crash in March; I just bought tech stocks and set 3-5% trailing stops, mostly nintendo/ttwo/logitech).

Last Friday I loaded up a hefty amount of SPY & RKT calls and got lucky on Monday. Sold 3/4 of my positions to re-capture my cost + some profits, and let the 1/4 ride.",2020-08-26 22:14:12
6769,"Lol I track MIK cuz like BBBY it's a good indicator of sentiment on retail and small caps. You're not wrong that the current new CEO (ex Target guy that ran the white label arm) brings a lot of value to MIK, but as far as I can feel they are still a 'value' and reopening play.

I rode it from $6 to $9 and obviously sold too early but these are minor positions. 

I think having six figures in a small cap that's getting daily 5-6% gain is a bit risky but good luck.",2020-08-26 20:48:56

Tsla, amd, nvda, fb, msft, appl, crm, and more. Jim Cramer may not be the smartest but he said something that really made me think: ""new wall street money managers aren't investing in old business. They want zero carbon emissions and healthy options."" This spoke to me. Ask yourself this: do you want to smoke cigarettes or eat a vegetarian burger? Do you want a tesla or a ford f150? Do you want a Playstation an Xbox? Do you use office 365? Want to go even more hard-core? Look at what kids 5-15 are doing now and invest in areas they are fucking with.

1. Yes, it's very unwise to bet against a casino stock amid a merger. (CZR / ERI)
2. If you're ITM and your direction is right, don't trade in the first hour after earnings. (BBBY $9 Put, got in at $700, got out before earnings at 1.2k, and next morning it fell through the floor, being jumpy lost me 3k more).
3. Pussy spreads (credit spreads on your direction) are much better than singles (thetagang) but limit your profit. 

4. THE Trend is your friend.. Brrrrt my 401k into the market.

6798,"BBBY just because they’re one of the cheaper stocks this works well on and they’re okay for the near future, but only do weekly or so and check up on them. They could transition to online sales and fewer stores so they could survive and stay around this price for awhile.

NCLH is another cheaper one if you believe they’ll survive the Rona.

Sell options around .20 to .30 delta for a decent premium and only 20-30% chance of it getting assigned to you. Puts have negative delta, same difference, do -.30 to -.20 delta.",2020-08-02 05:52:05

If I had the capital, the wheel is the relatively safe thing I’d be doing with part/most of my portfolio, it’s too slow for my small account but I’ll run it every now and then. Try it on BBBY, they’re cheap, have weekly options, and hopefully aren’t in trouble as they’ve bounced back after their bad earnings report.

And you’re right you can absolutely sell naked options if you’re approved for it, but you’ll need a margin account and you can go into debt selling them that way.",2020-08-01 17:33:04
