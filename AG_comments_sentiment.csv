"I had to revisit this post today, had way too much stuffed into my tiny monkey brain last night lol. This broke it down really well, thank you!! 

So, just to be clear: 

\- PSLV is fine, consistent, trustworthy, and we shouldn't worry about it squeeze-wise? 

\- SLV (an ETF) is owned by JP Morgan and they've been shorting silver for an incredibly long time. Buying up all of the silver from silver suppliers would require said suppliers to go back to JP Morgan and request more physical bars. When Jp Morgan goes ""uh oh"", the price of silver should start skyrocketing, because they've effectively created a massive shortage of silver that can't be circumvented, and it will continue to grow as industries heavily dependant on silver commodities drive the demand into space.

\- The above happening will (should) directly impact the exchange value of physical silver, but also rapidly increase the share value for SLV?

\- AG is just a mining company that provides silver for the entire market and will have the responsibility of basically helping out JP Morgan/silver suppliers as the demand for silver skyrockets. So investing in them should also be profitable?

I hope this makes sense. Remember, me dumb, me ape.","I had to revisit this post today, had way too much stuffed into my tiny monkey brain last night lol. This broke it down really well, thank you!!

The bait and switch with respect to Citadel being long SLV is a false flag. Yes, Citadel is long SLV. This is why we keep saying and have been saying since the start of last year that all you do by buying SLV is put money in bankers' pockets and let them dump more worthless paper on your head. The COMEX can't print fake silver to meet demand, if they don't deliver when asked for delivery it's a default and silver immediately goes to $1000. SLV is where they can print infinite shares because nobody can take delivery on SLV except the very same banks who are shorting silver. Hence why people need to buy PSLV so that Sprott can keep draining the COMEX.","

tl;dr the silver surfer hypothesis is that there are a lot of paper IOUs of silver covering a comparably tiny amount of actual metal. 

So basically the closer an investment is to the physical silver, the better. The absolute best would be to literally go on the futures market and order silver in bulk but the smallest orders (*with* current low prices, mind) cost anywhere from 50k to 100k. Second best would be physical silver from mints, bullion dealers, etc but you typically have to pay more of a premium since you aren't buying in bulk. Then you have trusts with guaranteed silver delivery (PSLV) but they also have a premium. Last are silver holding trusts which is what SLV counts as; they aren't *completely* useless since theoretically price increases mean they have to increase the collateral of physical silver but if there's an actual silver run then the price of the trusts will be dragged up regardless, just slower and by a smaller margin than physical or mining stocks.

Also, $AG (First Majestic Silver) combines the long term advantages of a silver miner with the short run advantages of a short squeeze (disclaimer: I bought into it last week). The CEO explicitly refuses to sell his silver to the COMEX and is fully bought into the silver surfer hypothesis, which is probably part of why the volume and short positions were so high (for a mining company, for a normal company it's small potatoes). It's the Gamestop of mining stocks in terms of volatility.","(not financial advice not financial advisor)

"$GME to the stars. Buy and hold, but diversify. 

There has been a lot of talk about Silver and $SLV recently, and with that comes the usual TRUE faults and MYTHS about any investment, so I am here to clear a few things up. 

THE CASE AGAINST SILVER and THE CASE FOR SILVER is mixed below:

You all are right: Citadel owns $SLV to the tune of $130 million. If Silver should hit $100 (the point at which over $15 billion in bank silver shorts will have to be closed at huge losses, Citadel could make as much as $400 million. Keep in mind, however, that they have lost, and will lose, much more in $GME. This is where the cost of bringing silver to it's true value comes in: Is it worth Citadel making $400 million after losing billions in order to cost banks tens of billions? That is for you to decide. (Note that $SLV MIGHT also collapse if prices rise too fast.)

MYTHS

Myth number 1: We are all Citadel boomer bots that want you to abandon $GME 

No, at least I don't think so. Do NOT sell your $GME to buy $SLV or $AG or physical Silver! That is not the purpose of the #silversqueeze movement. Keep your $GME, and buy more if you want. We are promoting diversifying assets. Again, don't sell your $GME to get into silver, but if you have extra cash around, it will be a great opportunity, even after rising from $23 to $27 in a matter of days.

Myth number 2: We want you to buy only $SLV

Not at all, if anything, $SLV isn't the way to take on the silver market. You can choose to buy it and miners if you want, but the real squeeze very well may come in the form of a massive shortage of physical Silver, which began yesterday. The squeeze will also be hand in hand with commodity contracts, but that is for you to research should you be so inclined. As far as bullion goes, there were no delays from bullion sites last week, but now, there are 10 day delays with the most popular bullion bars and coins being sold out until further notice. (You may still be able to get it at local dealers or some sites, albeit with higher premiums.)

Myth number 3: The silver market is HUGE and UNMOVABLE.

You couldn't be more wrong. Yes, we likely can't move the paper silver market, but there is only one ounce of physical Silver in the market for every 40 ounces in paper. That is where banks and shorts could get hurt. The movable physical supply is only worth $25 billion, far less than $NOK, or $BB and $GME combined. This is why most dealers are already out.

Final myth for the day: Silver has no use.

Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Silver is key to the future of tech. It is used by the ton for EVs, solar panels, computers, etc, which is leading to an inevitable widespread shortage because of its new purpose for cars and energy.

BUY and HOLD $GME, and add Silver!

"*repost for new silver autists*

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists.

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

If you want options then by silver micro futures on the CME groups COMEX. And you can take delivery of a minimum of 5000 ounces or 5 micro contracts.

Ag is just a silver miner that will not move silver price. But moving silver price will squeeze AG.

This is the way.","*repost for new silver autists*

The bankers use a derivatives market called the COMEX to manipulate the price of silver. 500 digital ounces of silver are traded back and forth for every real ounce held in the vaults. Equivalent to fractional reserve banking. The banks heavily short silver here. So much so that they would go bankrupt if the physical was taken delivery of.

"Buying physical silver is like holding the heads of the banks who are shorting underwater. Buying AG is like kicking them in the ass while their heads are down.

Miners go up when their primary price commodity price goes up (or when they have good news particular to their company). When people see the silver miners going up, they pile on. It's a feedback loop.

The reason AG is special is because A) there is a big short position against it, and B) their CEO is an outspoken advocate for silver. He held back his company's silver production during the absurdly low prices in spring 2020. That pissed off Wall Street. Think that might have something to do with the big short position?

The reason AG is special is because A) there is a big short position against it, and B) their CEO is an outspoken advocate for silver. He held back his company's silver production during the absurdly low prices in spring 2020. That pissed off Wall Street. Think that might have something to do with the big short position?

"I get my silver from https://silvergoldbull.com/ I also get Canadian silver 1oz maples.  About 5% more expensive but are internationally trusted, and being a currency gives it protection from government seizure.  At least this was the case in the 1930's how it would play out now we don't know.  

As to why I have purchased more silver it's because it's the currency of trade, its critically important in industry from medical, electronics,
 to solar panels. Physical silver will always have a massive value beyond a hedge against inflation.  Paper silver is also anywhere from 200x to 500x more common that physical silver.  If we buy up all the physical silver it will go to the moon!  The banks will lose the illusion that the fiat money printing isn't causing inflation.

**Silver: the Epitome of Wall Street manipulation & Its Achilles' heel - Why the AG short squeeze is very possible:**

1. **Naturally occuring, available quantity of gold/silver has a ratio of 1:8, yet the price ratio is 1:70!** This ratio could drop massively, increasing the silver price. That's not all (credits to [u/Mintmoondog](https://www.reddit.com/u/Mintmoondog/)): Remember, silver is significantly lighter than Au, so most of the historic Ag mines were nearer the surface of the earth - most of those have been depleted and today over 2/3 of Ag is mined as a by-product of other mines. The actual above ground number of ounces of silver is LESS than Gold! That is because over 40% of annual mining production of Ag is consumed (non-recoverable). The above ground inventory is so tight that a small group of autists and retards could theoretically wipe out most dealers' inventory in 30 minutes, using pocket change. This pushes the dealer to pressure the spot price. 🚀🚀 💎🙌💎
2. **Green & other future technologies** will require a lot of silver for efficiency purposes, since it’s the absolute best element to conduct electricity and has other unique properties that no other element can substitute. Many central banks (ECB & FED) have talked about **“green QE**” = buying corporate stocks that produce green energy technology = **Central bank indirectly funds the future silver short squize!** ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️🚀🚀🚀
3. **Silver is still 50% down from its all time high 10 years ago!** The quantity of silver mined has been far lower (end even decreasing) than the increase in inflation, and silver is a **good hedge against BOTH inflation AND deflation**, historically speaking. If accounted for monetary inflation, **the natural equilibrium price should be around 1000$**, but this can be pushed higher due to the massive short interest of the bullion banks. They already made loss from their silver shorts in 2020, but that was a fraction of the short interest they still have.☄️☄️🌚🌚
4. **Historic justice.** Silver price has been artificially kept down for nearly 100 years. First by the US government from 1935-1970, because it was too effective as a hedge against inflation. Afterwards, and this was confirmed by wikileaks, the US & London bankers took over this role by pushing the creation of the precious metals section at the COMEX, so that banks could artificially keep the price down. You see, they let the COMEX or LBMA sell future contracts and options, and each time many contracts are near expiry and ITM (profitable), they pull a massive naked short. This has been going on for 50 years. But unlike the G\*\* stock, it IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERVALUED. 🙌💎🚀
5. **The precedent.** The silver squize has happened before - when it went from 6$ -> 50$ from 1979-1980 - due to the Hunt brothers hoarding the physical and buying more via futures that were supposed to be delivered. But before this delivery, the COMEX changed the rules and demanded futures had to be backed by margin, which is why the brothers got an engineerd margin call. This caused the markets to panic-sell their silver, which ended the squize. If 2 brother can realize the silver squize, many retarded brothers can do the same: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver\_Thursday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday). Important to note here: the Hunts probably achieved their play because they uno-carded the big bullyon banks.

"**The retarded game of musical chairs.** They have so much short interest, and vastly overstated stored silver reserves (due to double counting & other deceptive accountancy practices), that ther's an ENORMOUS divergence between silver traded on paper and actual, physical silver: around 200-400x more paper silver than physical. GME is nothing compared to this. If every autistic retard here demands physical delivery or, even if staying stored in a vault, demands that their silver may not be lent out, the short squize of short squizes could easily be realized. 🔥🔥🚀🚀🤯🤯☄️

**What if there’s not enough Silver?** If they can’t hand over the physical silver, they will legally still be obligated to pay the price of that silver at the moment you exercised your ITM option/contract! But it gets better! If they indeed fail to deliver physical, they have to pay you the gains you made + a premium (extra money), to sort of buy you out of demanding the actual silver. If enough people would use their collective retardedness to decline this premium, the premium would only go up, as would the silver price! And since the counterparty of these options and contracts mostly are big investment banks, they absolutely have the $ to pay for this. Seems like a way more effective wealth transfer than stimmy. 🐻🐻🌈🌈

**Backwardation (retardation) & Shadow contracts.** Backwardation is the divergence between the spot price (= buy directly at this moment) and the futures price, more specifically, it means that the current price of spot is higher than the futures price. This is unnatural, and certainly in the present macro-economic environment, since it implies that financial actors expect that the price will drop. So why did we experience a lot of backwardation last year, during a bull run? Simple: there was such a strong demand that is was easier for providers to deliver later, since they didn't have enough physical in inventory. More backwardation = more signs that there is a lack of physical inventory. In fact, there were many signs that the backwardation and actual demand that was physically delivered, was suppressed with the use of ""shadow contracts"". These contracts are deliveries of physical that they try to hide with big boy accountancy tactics. **Increase in backwardation and shadow contract = squize squizing squizier till it will be squozed.** It's complicated but here's a great source that explains this: [https://www.desogames.com/shadowcontracts-and-a-history-of-comex-manipulation-in-2020/](https://www.desogames.com/shadowcontracts-and-a-history-of-comex-manipulation-in-2020/). 🐻🌈😤🙌💎

More on this, here: [https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand](https://silverseek.com/article/silver-shorts-last-stand)

1. **Technical case**. If the above wasn't enough, there's also a very strong technical case to be made, my fellow technicals-loving-autists. The bull run is written in the stars, as technical patterns and indicators predicted it long before WSB & larger retail knew about it. Here are the best chartists and analysts out there:

Buy? 100% physical-backed futures/options or just **pure physical silver** = **a)** **PSLV**, **b)** **AG** & **c)** **Miners** (= less effiencient, but can multiply if spot rises) **d)** Delivery from warehouses for you rich autists that can take them without margin.

**!! DON'T BUY CDF's or FOREX Silver or unbacked futures/option - they're NOT backed and could prove worthless + they facilitate naked short manipulation !!**

As of writing, the spot **price of silver already rose from $24,8 on 28/01 to 27,6$ on 29/01**. This is just the beginning. **Give me Silver and tendies or give me death!**

"DON’T USE MARGIN!!!🥈🥈🥈🥈

This needs to be said but it will be a moot point come Monday. When you use margin it can make it difficult to sleep at night as many of us know. Game stop is sticking it to the man in Wall Street. Forcing the world to revalue silver to where it properly belongs is sticking it to central banks and government around the world. They will hold out and do everything possible to prevent silver from blowing shy high in a short amount of time.  If you buy physical and SLV and AG and others without margin you can sit back and wait and not get tricked or controlled into selling into downward pressure.  That being said, I will bet a 100oz bar of real silver that come Monday am all trading platforms will make SLV AG and most other high profile silver stocks non marginable. This is a legal way of slowing the price acceleration of silver. You won’t be able to buy as many shares if you can’t but they on margin. That’s ok though, that is our sign that this is working. So we buy, hold and wait and buy more later as paychecks permit. Educate yourselves in to what is really going on in our world from a financial perspective. The more fake money they print and disperse to the peasants the higher silver and gold are going to go. Educate, and then educate those you care about, this new financial opportunity is not about making a quick buck, it’s about surviving what is coming financially, and for those unprepared it won’t be pretty","DON’T USE MARGIN!!!🥈🥈🥈🥈

"Hey I ain’t no Bot! 

I’m a retail silver / uranium  investor and I can assure you this silver thing is for real - I only arrived here last week as the manipulation your WSB $GME faced struck something in us to act - our own market manipulation it’s huge but hard to understand as it’s so deeply manipulated!!

We have sent a wave of physical silver bullion buying worldwide last 3 days and this $SLV is Limit up currently - it’s working.

The $SLV is a trading tool most will use to squeeze the silver futures - but the bankers will also use it... 

for some people it’s seen as a compromised instrument as it’s ran by the very people who are shorting against us.... manipulated TF 

In mining stock investing we face Naked shorting all the time and our stocks get hammered -  a project called Save Canadian mining is trying to get this outlawed but with no success. 

Anyway don’t just sell $AG or anything yet - and look into $PSLV - it’s a Silver ETF that takes silver bullion off the Comex Banksters scheming hands and is then held by Sprott who run the ETF in the Canadian mint - this screws the Comex fraud as it’s taking physical silver out there hands.

Folks, Wall Street Was Almost Totally Blown Up This Week, Here's Why

Think about it using critical thinking skills. We just had the most blatant, in your face, coordinated stock manipulations in history. Why would some of the biggest names in Wall Street do something like this? Do you really think they'd do this to avoid losing a few billion or even a hundred billion in a few week time frame?!? Hell no, they know it's a rigged system and they'll make those losses back in a month or two... by mid year at the worse. It's not called the Wall Street Casino for nothing. The house always wins.

Here is what probably happened. My theory only. The entire Wall Street system was about to be blown up and sucked into a massive cross asset, margin call, algo feeding frenzy that was going to bring the whole system down. We all know the big hedge funds are leveraged to the hilt. All the billionaires and all the big firm are. That's how they make more billions. When their highly leveraged rigged bets started to go against them, they had massive margin calls. Everyone was calling everyone saying you need to pony up more money. Trading firms, settlement firms, hedge funds, you name it, pony up more money. However, unfortunately for them they did not have that money just laying around waiting for margin calls. They never expected that.

Now what happens next. Since their cash is in highly leveraged bets they need to start selling their winners to avoid covering shorts and taking losses on the losers. This is what they did. They thought they could wait it out and WSB would go away. However, when the pre-market on Thursday was so strong on the most shorted stocks, they saw their margin calls were going to increase and they'd have to continue selling winners to cover their increasing losses on shorts. This was going to set off stop loss orders across the board and a death spiral ensues. The algos were about to begin feeding on each other in a race to the bottom.

Folks, Wall Street Was Almost Totally Blown Up This Week, Here's Why

Think about it using critical thinking skills. We just had the most blatant, in your face, coordinated stock manipulations in history. Why would some of the biggest names in Wall Street do something like this? Do you really think they'd do this to avoid losing a few billion or even a hundred billion in a few week time frame?!? Hell no, they know it's a rigged system and they'll make those losses back in a month or two... by mid year at the worse. It's not called the Wall Street Casino for nothing. The house always wins.

Here is what probably happened. My theory only. The entire Wall Street system was about to be blown up and sucked into a massive cross asset, margin call, algo feeding frenzy that was going to bring the whole system down. We all know the big hedge funds are leveraged to the hilt. All the billionaires and all the big firm are. That's how they make more billions. When their highly leveraged rigged bets started to go against them, they had massive margin calls. Everyone was calling everyone saying you need to pony up more money. Trading firms, settlement firms, hedge funds, you name it, pony up more money. However, unfortunately for them they did not have that money just laying around waiting for margin calls. They never expected that.

Now what happens next. Since their cash is in highly leveraged bets they need to start selling their winners to avoid covering shorts and taking losses on the losers. This is what they did. They thought they could wait it out and WSB would go away. However, when the pre-market on Thursday was so strong on the most shorted stocks, they saw their margin calls were going to increase and they'd have to continue selling winners to cover their increasing losses on shorts. This was going to set off stop loss orders across the board and a death spiral ensues. The algos were about to begin feeding on each other in a race to the bottom.

"No, pumping AG won't do anything to silver market itself. It's just that some posts that went viral were promoting AG.","No, pumping AG won't do anything to silver market itself. It's just that some posts that went viral were promoting AG.",0.077
"

**Silver: the Epitome of Wall Street manipulation & Its Achilles' heel - Why the AG short squeeze is very possible:**

1. **Naturally occuring, available quantity of gold/silver has a ratio of 1:8, yet the price ratio is 1:70!** This ratio could drop massively, increasing the silver price. That's not all (credits to [u/Mintmoondog](https://www.reddit.com/u/Mintmoondog/)): Remember, silver is significantly lighter than Au, so most of the historic Ag mines were nearer the surface of the earth - most of those have been depleted and today over 2/3 of Ag is mined as a by-product of other mines. The actual above ground number of ounces of silver is LESS than Gold! That is because over 40% of annual mining production of Ag is consumed (non-recoverable). The above ground inventory is so tight that a small group of autists and retards could theoretically wipe out most dealers' inventory in 30 minutes, using pocket change. This pushes the dealer to pressure the spot price. 🚀🚀 💎🙌💎
2. **Green & other future technologies** will require a lot of silver for efficiency purposes, since it’s the absolute best element to conduct electricity and has other unique properties that no other element can substitute. Many central banks (ECB & FED) have talked about **“green QE**” = buying corporate stocks that produce green energy technology = **Central bank indirectly funds the future silver short squize!** ⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️⚡️🚀🚀🚀
3. **Silver is still 50% down from its all time high 10 years ago!** The quantity of silver mined has been far lower (end even decreasing) than the increase in inflation, and silver is a **good hedge against BOTH inflation AND deflation**, historically speaking. If accounted for monetary inflation, **the natural equilibrium price should be around 1000$**, but this can be pushed higher due to the massive short interest of the bullion banks. They already made loss from their silver shorts in 2020, but that was a fraction of the short interest they still have.☄️☄️🌚🌚
4. **Historic justice.** Silver price has been artificially kept down for nearly 100 years. First by the US government from 1935-1970, because it was too effective as a hedge against inflation. Afterwards, and this was confirmed by wikileaks, the US & London bankers took over this role by pushing the creation of the precious metals section at the COMEX, so that banks could artificially keep the price down. You see, they let the COMEX or LBMA sell future contracts and options, and each time many contracts are near expiry and ITM (profitable), they pull a massive naked short. This has been going on for 50 years. But unlike the G\*\* stock, it IS FUNDAMENTALLY UNDERVALUED. 🙌💎🚀
5. **The precedent.** The silver squize has happened before - when it went from 6$ -> 50$ from 1979-1980 - due to the Hunt brothers hoarding the physical and buying more via futures that were supposed to be delivered. But before this delivery, the COMEX changed the rules and demanded futures had to be backed by margin, which is why the brothers got an engineerd margin call. This caused the markets to panic-sell their silver, which ended the squize. If 2 brother can realize the silver squize, many retarded brothers can do the same: [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver\_Thursday](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday)  
. Important to note here: the Hunts probably achieved their play because they uno-carded the big bullyon banks. More in this, and the legal details, here (p60-70): [https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@swaps/documents/file/hrep97-565.pdf](https://www.cftc.gov/sites/default/files/idc/groups/public/@swaps/documents/file/hrep97-565.pdf).
6. **The retarded game of musical chairs.** They have so much short interest, and vastly overstated stored silver reserves (due to double counting & other deceptive accountancy practices), that ther's an ENORMOUS divergence between silver traded on paper and actual, physical silver: around 200-400x more paper silver than physical. GME is nothing compared to this. If every autistic retard here demands physical delivery or, even if staying stored in a vault, demands that their silver may not be lent out, the short squize of short squizes could easily be realized. 🔥🔥🚀🚀🤯🤯☄️
7. **What if there’s not enough Silver?** If they can’t hand over the physical silver, they will legally still be obligated to pay the price of that silver at the moment you exercised your ITM option/contract! But it gets better! If they indeed fail to deliver physical, they have to pay you the gains you made + a premium (extra money), to sort of buy you out of demanding the actual silver. If enough people would use their collective retardedness to decline this premium, the premium would only go up, as would the silver price! And since the counterparty of these options and contracts mostly are big investment banks, they absolutely have the $ to pay for this. Seems like a way more effective wealth transfer than stimmy. 🐻🐻🌈🌈
8. **Backwardation (retardation) & Shadow contracts.** Backwardation is the divergence between the spot price (= buy directly at this moment) and the futures price, more specifically, it means that the current price of spot is higher than the futures price. This is unnatural, and certainly in the present macro-economic environment, since it implies that financial actors expect that the price will drop. So why did we experience a lot of backwardation last year, during a bull run? Simple: there was such a strong demand that is was easier for providers to deliver later, since they didn't have enough physical in inventory. More backwardation = more signs that there is a lack of physical inventory. In fact, there were many signs that the backwardation and actual demand that was physically delivered, was suppressed with the use of ""shadow contracts"". These contracts are deliveries of physical that they try to hide with big boy accountancy tactics. **Increase in backwardation and shadow contract = squize squizing squizier till it will be squozed.** It's complicated but here's a great source that explains this: [https://www.desogames.com/shadowcontracts-and-a-history-of-comex-manipulation-in-2020/](https://www.desogames.com/shadowcontracts-and-a-history-of-comex-manipulation-in-2020/)  
. 🐻🌈😤🙌💎
9. **Can't issue more silver** \- unlike the fact you can issue more stocks/fiat! Furthermore, it's an extremely safe store of value - as electronic means of payment are dependant on electricity. When silver starts to moon, states - especially 🐻🌈 authoritarian states - will scramble to get a strategic supply and thus feed us many a tendies. Also, it is an amazing hedge against the unavoidable future inflation, which is necessary to monetize our global debt. Physical ownership also deters paper hands. Lastly, it takes YEARS to properly set u a mine. Today, there's also a growing risk 🐻🌈states will nationalize their mines, further constricting supply. More on this from Silver billionaire Kaplan, who is now bullish silver again: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvb-wvVl2D8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvb-wvVl2D8)

10. **Alpha 🐻🌈 JPM has our backs!** JPM, due to its actions, is probably on a tight rope above a valley of agressive criminal lawsuits (according to the source below) - for at least the coming few years. It has therefore ended most silver shorts and now mostly holds physical silver. They know they can't short much anymore, because the schmuckery needed to manipulate such fundamentals would be gravely persecuted. This is great. The shorts have been taken over by smaller, Melvin-like institutions. These already showed they are way worse at manipulating. Eventually, JPM will ride the wave with the plebs, since the worth of their own pyhysical would then grow multiples! **Retards will ride the alpha 🐻🌈 to fuck the beta 🐻🌈🐻🌈**.

11. **Technical case**. If the above wasn't enough, there's also a very strong technical case to be made, my fellow technicals-loving-autists. The bull run is written in the stars, as technical patterns and indicators predicted it long before WSB & larger retail knew about it. Here are the best chartists and analysts out there:

"I think you are seriously at the point where manipulation is what you want here.  steering everyone into GME vs just letting people discuss whatever play they want, that is a line this post is crossing.

Theres quite a few people who enjoy WSB as a community who are not comfortable piling into GME at $320+.   Sure it might go to $10k.

But making threads to steer people directly to the one cause some of you really want everyone into, and deleting others is probably something people could look at.

"IMO good times ahead for silver and $AG. Silver has taken off and coming weeks and months will show where it ends up. My play here is $AG which benefits directly from the every bit silver goes up. $AG may even double or triple quickly, as in addition to favourable sentiment with silver, there's lot of shorts in $AG which we'll squeeze and we'll squeeze long and hard! No rush to take the profits. Plan is to buy a bit more $AG from Germany (FMV ticker) when opening on Monday and then just HOLD patiently. Currently I'm up about 25%, but no way I'm selling anytime soon because of shorts! Now it's waiting game for $AG and maybe buy some dips. 

This not an investment advice to anyone and remember to bet only what you're afford to lose.

"*repost for new silver autists*

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists. 

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

If you want options then by silver micro futures on the CME groups COMEX. And you can take delivery of a minimum of 5000 ounces or 5 micro contracts.

Ag is just a silver miner that will not move silver price. But moving silver price will squeeze AG.

"THE BIGGEST SHORT SQUEEZE IN THE WORLD

Silver Bullion Market is one of the most manipulated on earth. Any short squeeze in silver paper shorts would be EPIC. We know billion banks are manipulating gold and silver to cover real inflation.

Both the industrial case and monetary case, debt printing has never been more favorable for the No. 1 inflation hedge Silver.

Inflation adjusted Silver should be at 1000$ instead of 25$.

SLV vs PSLV

Hi master!! In our debate about of which ETF is the best for our purposes (PSLV or SLV) I think that obviously the choice is SLV. Many people try to discredit it putting in doubt that it holds all the silver that it should, but I think that this had been always biased propaganda by the bullion dealers. SLV is run by BlackRock, who has many, many, many more assets under management than the SLV (in fact SLV is one of their smallest funds). Will such a leader of the investment industry put its reputation in risk??? Some years ago (in the darkest recent age of silver, about 2013-2015), the short interest in SLV was much higher than nowadays (about 25-30%). Ted Butler always defended that shorting the SLV was not permitted by the ETF prospectus itself, because shorting one share inhibits the adding one Oz of silver (you can sell one share to a new investor without issuing it). He initiated a public campaign against BlackRock by permitting it. The result was a legal threat of BlackRock to Butler, he had to retreat, but magically the short interest started to decrease during the next weeks/months till ""symbolic"" levels. Even during this last year, where we witnessing silver inflow to the trust of several hundreds oz more over the year before, the short interest of SLV itself didn't rise. SLV itself has no meaningful short interest itself, but the arbitrage among it and the spot/futures market make the concentrated shorts of the Comex very vulnerable. And remember, the master of the crooks, the one with the biggest and more corrupt influences, JPM, is no longer in the short side, so it will be no threated and by that will do nothing.

Advantages of SLV over PSLV are clear:

•	⁠Much more available on brokers (unless in Europe due to MiFid II)
•	⁠Much more liquid
•	⁠And of course, it has options!!

Tldr- Corner the market.   I THINK WE CAN DO IT. BUY physical,  $SLV GO ALL IN TH GAINS WILL BE UNLIMITED. DEMAND PHYSICAL IF YOU CAN. FUCK THE SUITS.

"I agree with GME first. For silver it would be a lot of fun and there are few different options.

My preference would be a combo of AG stock and physical. 

AG has a pretty good short position so a squeeze is possible. That would be step one. 

Step two is to buy buy buy physical silver. Not the paper crap. Preferably by the bullion from the store operated by AG. That way you increase the profits of the company you own stock in while pulling physical from the market. More profits are good for AG. Higher silver price is good for AG. Shorts covering is good for AG. 

There really isn't even all that much silver available to buy. I mean a lot, but less than one would imagine. The bullion dealers are paying  pretty high premiums right now to buy silver from individuals.

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists. 

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

If you want options then by silver micro futures on the CME groups COMEX. And you can take delivery of a minimum of 5000 ounces or 5 micro contracts.

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists. 

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

Ag is just a silver miner that will not move silver price. But moving silver price will squeeze AG.

This is the way.","repost for new autists

They have realized that the biggest con game in town has been the rigging of silver prices. Banks have been heavily ""net short"" silver for years. If the price of silver stays low, the perceived value of the U.S. dollar remains relatively intact. Increased buying of silver – which we saw today – might actually force some folks on Wall Street to consider where they would find a place to buy and store more physical silver themselves. As Garrett explained in his update... If everyone buys some silver, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV) and Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV) exchange-traded funds will be forced to go into the market and buy physical silver. Unlike stocks, physical silver supply is finite. The overwhelming demand will spike silver prices higher. The large banks use futures contracts and other derivatives to short the silver price. Right now, they are short hundreds of millions of silver ounces and stand to lose billions of dollars with every $1 rise in the price of silver. This morning, silver traded up more than 5% to around $26.30 per ounce","AG is the GME of Silver and we should exploit it along with PSLV see below for explanation
 
They have realized that the biggest con game in town has been the rigging of silver prices. Banks have been heavily ""net short"" silver for years. If the price of silver stays low, the perceived value of the U.S. dollar remains relatively intact. Increased buying of silver – which we saw today – might actually force some folks on Wall Street to consider where they would find a place to buy and store more physical silver themselves.

It happened last spring.  When the Covid hit everything tanked and the premium on silver skyrocketed when the comex price dropped.  There was literally no metal to buy.  Then the price shot up.  That was normal trading.  Imagine what would happen if all of the dimwits around here would buy a $1000 worth of physical and through another $1000 at AG.  The short would get squeezed from both physical side and paper side.,It happened last spring.

"Food for thought: Silver is significantly lighter than gold - so most of the historic silver mines were closer to the surface. Most of these have been mined out. That is why

"Folks, Wall Street Was Almost Totally Blown Up This Week, Here's Why

Think about it using critical thinking skills. We just had the most blatant, in your face, coordinated stock manipulations in history. Why would some of the biggest names in Wall Street do something like this? Do you really think they'd do this to avoid losing a few billion or even a hundred billion in a few week time frame?!? Hell no, they know it's a rigged system and they'll make those losses back in a month or two... by mid year at the worse. It's not called the Wall Street Casino for nothing. The house always wins.

Here is what probably happened. My theory only. The entire Wall Street system was about to be blown up and sucked into a massive cross asset, margin call, algo feeding frenzy that was going to bring the whole system down. We all know the big hedge funds are leveraged to the hilt. All the billionaires and all the big firm are. That's how they make more billions. When their highly leveraged rigged bets started to go against them, they had massive margin calls. Everyone was calling everyone saying you need to pony up more money. Trading firms, settlement firms, hedge funds, you name it, pony up more money. However, unfortunately for them they did not have that money just laying around waiting for margin calls. They never expected that.

Now what happens next. Since their cash is in highly leveraged bets they need to start selling their winners to avoid covering shorts and taking losses on the losers. This is what they did. They thought they could wait it out and WSB would go away. However, when the pre-market on Thursday was so strong on the most shorted stocks, they saw their margin calls were going to increase and they'd have to continue selling winners to cover their increasing losses on shorts. This was going to set off stop loss orders across the board and a death spiral ensues. The algos were about to begin feeding on each other in a race to the bottom. 

The entire market spectrum gets repriced in no time. Stock longs, shorts, options, futures, CDOs, CDSs, uncovered calls, uncovered puts, you name it. The entire fake and manipulated system goes down in flames by Friday's options expirations. I think this is what they want (to tank the system) in the end but not now. They want it where they win and the little guy is bankrupted when it happens and they're not positioned for that yet. That way they get all our homes, cars, and other assets on the cheap like they did in 2008.

The Texas AG just filed a civil investigation and demanded preservation of evidence from several firms. We see figures on both sides of the political spectrum calling for investigations. When else would you see Ted Cruz and AOC agreeing on an issue. The big money knows they screwed up big time and they're pissed at the little guy for ""doing this to them."" People are likely going to prison. I'd hate to be the RH CEO right now or any of their top execs. Not to mention Citadel or IBKR. Once again, why would they take this risk? Because the entire fake and manipulated system was about to go down in flames and they were finished is the only logical answer.

Stay strong my brothers and sisters. This is not over. We will change the system for the better for your  generation and generations to come.","Folks, Wall Street Was Almost Totally Blown Up This Week, Here's Why

"repost for new autists

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists. 

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

AG is just a silver miner and wont move silver price at all.

"repost for new autists

The reason the banks can have 200 pieces of paper, that represent an ounce of silver, for every 1 ounce of real silver they actually have is because nobody forces them to deliver the silver. The buyers just hold onto the piece of paper. Then one day they sell their piece of paper for currency (dollars) without ever making the banks cough up the silver. The banks have taken advantage of traders not ever taking delivery of real silver.They made more and more paper receipts that simply track the going price of real silver they dont have, In order to create far more supply of silver than exists. 

Chief among these banks is JP morgan who RUNS the SLV ETF. Keep this in mind when deciding between SLV and PSLV which is vastly more trustworthy and will deliver silver against shares on demand. (SLV does not)

When you buy real silver and sit on it, then the bullion dealer you bought it from has to restock his inventory. which means he goes out and reduces the real supply. Of silver. If enough people do this the banks will start to have to make good. because the industrial users of silver dont give a damn what the price is. They need it and the banks have receipts that say they got it. They will force the banks to make good on their comex contracts like no retard here possibly could. Causing a massive increase of price that will feed on itself.

AG is just a silver miner. Wont move the silver price itself even a little. 

This is the way.","repost for new autists

"Why is silver (and gold) price manipulation allowed?  It benefits many big players and some governments.

China and Russia want low metal prices.  Why?  Because they are steadily reducing their exposure to U.S. dollar denominated securities in favor of precious metals.  Buyers of precious metals, like China and Russia, obviously like the price to stay low over the course of several years while they continue to accumulate.

"I have followed metals markets for a long time (since before the 07/08 depression) and I believe the reasoning here is both accurate and sound.

(Only one correction, silver is not the most manipulated metal, by far and away its copper.  All the big banks do it, and The PRC as well.  China secretly buys  copper when the price low enough - as secretly possible, you can uncover it with good deceive work but no one cares...-stockpiles it, then dumps it on the market for a profit when the price is high, until it drops again.  They then rinse and repeat.)

All that to point out that while JPM is not the PRC, I still don’t think it’s possible to “take down” JPM.

Here is the good news though.  We wouldn’t have to “take them down” in order to force major changes.  They can be burned pretty badly on this trade, and since profits are both their King and Queen, they’ll not soon forget that lesson.

Plus, we can make millions of small silver retail investors giddily happy.  (Silver has been long referred to as the poor man’s gold).

With the ever increasing industrial uses of silver and the amount of of time it takes to get even a well cared for brownfield site up and productive, this has a far, far longer runway than the GameStop trade, which is limited by the number of fools brave enough to keep shorting it.

Especially if retail investors start demanding physical delivery of small lots of silver, which is not only a financial problem but a logistical nightmare for exchanges.

The natural end result here is that A) The silver trusts & the exchanges will have to acknowledge they can no longer guarantee they are backed by actual silver, (which effectively kills their ability to manipulate the silver markets or B) SEC regulators will step in and try as best they can to regulate this trade to death to make it unworkable.
Or, most likely A and B will both happen.

The end result is that silver should remain at a much higher level than it is now, and in much closer alignment to historical ratios.

And also, ancillary mining trades like longer dated calls on AG and PAAS, and on streamers like WPM should benefit nicely as secondary trades.

The two things that make this workable are the physical delivery of silver contracts and the constant established and growing industrial uses for silver.

FYI these are my personal thoughts and opinions only.  I don’t give, take, or even pay attention to any sort of financial advice except for entertainment purposes.  And this is all pretty darn entertaining.  Whatever you choose to do or not do is your own business, and responsibility, not mine, not anyone else’s.
Make sure whatever you do financially doesn’t keep you up at night because insomnia is bear.
Which is really ironic, because bears hibernate.

I collect bullion for my kid so alot of coins are mickey mini related shit like that. That is a huge range for everything. But for solid melt value plus 2 percent for just buying silver cost a dollar 2 more then spot but for maximum value without the hallmark thats the way to go. And candian maples are more but there 9999.

"Newbie here, boomer, autistic investing in silver for 40 years.  Bought in to GME late last week at average price of around $300, and holding.  I believe silver will soon begin sharply escalating in price, and will continue to rise until the U.S. dollar completely collapses - which may take between 3 months or 2 years.  I expect silver to rise from the current price of $27.00 per ounce to at least $1,000.  Sprott Physical Silver Trust is an ETF , Ticker Symbol PSLV, that buys silver bullion in the open market and keeps it in secure storage.  Unlike SLV, PSLV has no options trading available but PSLV has the more honest and reliable management company.  Since we are on the verge of hyper-inflation and collapse of the dollar, silver is not only the best investment profit opportunity but also the safest place to keep your money.  I own shares of PSLV because I believe it is the safest vehicle for silver investing, and I also have a position in a silver mining company named First Majestic Silver, Ticker Symbol: AG, which has short squeeze potential.  This is only my opinion and not investment advice.  From here, silver has nowhere to go but up.","Newbie here, boomer, autistic investing in silver for 40 years.

"First off, obligatory HOLD and BUY $GME, $AMC, etc. We are going to the stars.

I am here to reiterate the post from a few days ago and make the case against big banking. Silver has risen to $27/oz in the last two spikes in trading. What better opportunity will present itself in the wake of Wall Street trying to stop us than Silver?

We beat the big shorts. There will still be some time to defeat the rest of the shorts and those who reloaded over the next period of time, but once we have claimed total victory, where do we go next? Wall Street will lose, that is certain. But with the stunts pulled by Robinhood to save their friends at Citadel, they will be prepared for the stocks we may like to buy next. What better opportunity is there, then, than to buy a good investment that big banking is shorting?

For decades, they have manipulated Silver prices at the cost of small buyers and those who see it's true value. Silver is half of the price it was in 1980, while the money supply has ballooned by the tens of trillions. Even after all of the price suppression Silver has endured, big banking like JPMorgan has taken out massive shorts against the metal.

THE SITUATION

Once we take everything from the shorts in GME, it is time, my fellow degenerates, to show big banking our true power (DISCLAIMER, not by attacking them financially or by being organized, but rather by finding a good investment). The entire physical Silver supply amounts to $20 Billion, while the paper supply, much of which is shorted, numbers in the trillions. For every ounce of physical Silver, there is two ounces in short positions. Also, for every dollar that spot Silver rises, the shorts will have to close over $200 million in positions. A purchase of just a fraction of the $20 billion in physical Silver and it's counterparts (AG, SLV, etc.), will likely trigger the price to skyrocket. Remember the benchmark: At $500, most big banks will be forced to close their shorts at phenomenal losses.

The time will come, my friends, where GME has given us a full and wonderful victory. When that time comes, Silver will be heading to the moon, then the stars, and will finally reach it's true value. 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑

WE LIKE THE STOCK and WE LIKE THE METAL

tldr: Buy and Hold $GME, but look into silver as well.

"$AG and $SLV were outlined this week as targets for a new GME style silver squeeze. I read a book and watched hours of talks on this to fully understand it, which I've outlined below.

Basically, demand exceeds supply, and neither have anything to do with the price because this is all manipulated by JPM and other banks, while they silently accumulate massive positions. Any buying catalyst that moves the price beyond $50 could be enough to to trigger a massive upwards move.

Thesis on Silver:

A. Silver prices are being intentionally kept low by JPM and others to allow central banks/JPM to accumulate silver for the past 8 years.

B. Price reflects paper trading in derivatives/futures market rather than supply and demand factors.

C. Silver has far more uses than gold and is a key component of solar panels, electronics, and the EV revolution.

D. Mining is now unprofitable for several miners due to the low prices, and thus reduced supply.

E. JPM and other banks paid +1 billion for rare metals market manipulation during the previous 8 years.

A. 8 years of accumulation - JPM has amassed the world's largest supply of silver at 900 million ounces. Yearly demand is 950 million ounces, where close to 80% of that is for industrial uses, and therefore 100-200 million ounces is for investment.

B. Price divergence from supply and demand - US mint produces ""silver eagles"" each year and always runs out, in 2019 they ran out in February. Over the past 8 years there have been months were silver was on backorder with a lead time of over 3 months from any of the 5 major global mints.

C. Silver is used in practically all electronics and is a key component in everything from electric vehicles, to solar panels. Dupont has greatly reduced the amount of silver needed for their silver paste during recent years, and demand is still quite high. Silver is not just a store of value.

D. Several miners have shut down unprofitable mines, and (almost) all cost reductions in operations have already taken place. New mines take 5+ years to become operable. The vast majority of silver comes as a byproduct from mining other basic metals. Miners have no control over the price because supply/demand have no effect.

E. Regulators (CFRC) have ignored whistleblowers, and sometimes don't even respond. Documented group chats from traders bragging about how they can manipulate the markets are in the public domain and nothing has been done. The irony is that JPM is the custodian of $SLV, meaning that they are the ones responsible for purchasing and storing silver, while also paying fines for manipulation.

Futures contracts are supposed to delivered in silver, but are also deliverable in cash if silver is not available. Obviously if silver is not available to be delivered then the price should reflect this, but it doesn't.

Silver Manipulation Critics:

1. Ted Butler - has been calling this out for decades.
2. Chris Marcus - The Big Silver Short

Major Historical Events:

1. 1979-1980 Hunt Brothers try to corner market. Buy up 30% of silver and price goes from $5 to $50. COMEX restricts all buying and pressures for margin requirement changes. Everyday people start selling their silver which provides liquidity. Hunt brothers lose billions. They 100 million ounces approximately and had derivatives contracts for another 125 million.
2. 1997 Warren Buffet buys up silver. 100 million ounces. Price doubles from $5-10. Rumors of pressure that forced him to sell and book a $100 million profit.
3. 2008 silver price drops from $20 to $9 within weeks/months on financial recession news, the opposite of what anyone would expect.
4. 2011 silver price runs up to $49. 40-49 was due to short squeeze. Sunday evening $6 selloff, highly abnormal and possible manipulation.

During the 2008 Great Recession, JPM received 30 billion dollars to takeover Bear Stearn's positions. One of these was a short position on silver that was so big that they needed special and temporary regulatory approval to put it on their books. They were supposed to shrink the position to a reasonable size within 6 months; instead, they initially added to it.

I am not an investment professional, just a fellow autist who likes shiny things.

\##########################################################################","$AG and $SLV were outlined this week as targets for a new GME style silver squeeze. I read a book and watched hours of talks on this to fully understand it, which I've outlined below.

Basically, demand exceeds supply, and neither have anything to do with the price because this is all manipulated by JPM and other banks, while they silently accumulate massive positions. Any buying catalyst that moves the price beyond $50 could be enough to to trigger a massive upwards move.

Thesis on Silver:

A. Silver prices are being intentionally kept low by JPM and others to allow central banks/JPM to accumulate silver for the past 8 years.

B. Price reflects paper trading in derivatives/futures market rather than supply and demand factors.

C. Silver has far more uses than gold and is a key component of solar panels, electronics, and the EV revolution.

D. Mining is now unprofitable for several miners due to the low prices, and thus reduced supply.

E. JPM and other banks paid +1 billion for rare metals market manipulation during the previous 8 years.

A. 8 years of accumulation - JPM has amassed the world's largest supply of silver at 900 million ounces. Yearly demand is 950 million ounces, where close to 80% of that is for industrial uses, and therefore 100-200 million ounces is for investment.

B. Price divergence from supply and demand - US mint produces ""silver eagles"" each year and always runs out, in 2019 they ran out in February. Over the past 8 years there have been months were silver was on backorder with a lead time of over 3 months from any of the 5 major global mints.

C. Silver is used in practically all electronics and is a key component in everything from electric vehicles, to solar panels. Dupont has greatly reduced the amount of silver needed for their silver paste during recent years, and demand is still quite high. Silver is not just a store of value.

D. Several miners have shut down unprofitable mines, and (almost) all cost reductions in operations have already taken place. New mines take 5+ years to become operable. The vast majority of silver comes as a byproduct from mining other basic metals. Miners have no control over the price because supply/demand have no effect.

E. Regulators (CFRC) have ignored whistleblowers, and sometimes don't even respond. Documented group chats from traders bragging about how they can manipulate the markets are in the public domain and nothing has been done. The irony is that JPM is the custodian of $SLV, meaning that they are the ones responsible for purchasing and storing silver, while also paying fines for manipulation.

Futures contracts are supposed to delivered in silver, but are also deliverable in cash if silver is not available. Obviously if silver is not available to be delivered then the price should reflect this, but it doesn't.

"First off, obligatory HOLD and BUY $GME, $AMC, etc. We are going to the stars.

I am here to reiterate the post from a couple of days ago and make the case against big banking. Silver has risen to $27/oz in the last two spikes in trading. What better opportunity will present itself in the wake of Wall Street trying to stop us than Silver?

We beat the big shorts. There will still be some time to defeat the rest of the shorts and those who reloaded over the next period of time, but once we have claimed total victory, where do we go next? Wall Street will lose, that is certain. But with the stunts pulled by Robinhood to save their friends at Citadel, they will be prepared for the stocks we may like to buy next. What better opportunity is there, then, than to buy a good investment that big banking is shorting?

For decades, they have manipulated Silver prices at the cost of small buyers and those who see it's true value. Silver is half of the price it was in 1980, while the money supply has ballooned by the tens of trillions. Even after all of the price suppression Silver has endured, big banking like JPMorgan has taken out massive shorts against the metal.

THE SITUATION

Once we take everything from the shorts in GME, it is time, my fellow degenerates, to show big banking our true power (DISCLAIMER, not attack them financially or be organized). The entire physical Silver supply amounts to $20 Billion, while the paper supply, much of which is shorted, numbers in the trillions. For every ounce of physical Silver, there is two ounces in short positions. Also, for every dollar that spot Silver rises, the shorts will have to close over $200 million in positions. A purchase of just a fraction of the $20 billion in physical Silver and it's counterparts (AG, SLV, etc.), will likely trigger the price to skyrocket. Remember the benchmark: At $500, most big banks will be forced to close their shorts at phenomenal losses.

The time will come, my friends, where GME has given us a full and wonderful victory. When that time comes, Silver will be heading to the moon, then the stars, and will finally reach it's true value. 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑

"We will squeeze $GME even further, but if we have any extra cash, there may be another opportunity as well. First off, HOLD and BUY $GME. We are going to the stars.

I am here to reiterate the post from a couple of days ago and make the case against big banking. Silver has risen to $27/oz in the last two spikes in trading. What better opportunity will present itself in the wake of Wall Street trying to stop us than Silver?

We beat the big shorts. There will still be some time to defeat the rest of the shorts and those who reloaded over the next period of time, but once we have claimed total victory, where do we go next? Wall Street will lose, that is certain. But with the stunts pulled by Robinhood to save their friends at Citadel, they will be prepared for the stocks we may target next. What better opportunity is there, then, than to go after big banking?

For decades, they have manipulated Silver prices at the cost of small buyers and those who see it's true value. Silver is half of the price it was in 1980, while the money supply has ballooned by the tens of trillions. Even after all of the price suppression Silver has endured, big banking like JPMorgan has taken out massive shorts against the metal.

THE SITUATION

Once we take everything from the shorts in GME, it is time, my fellow degenerates, to show big banking our true power. The entire physical Silver supply amounts to $20 Billion, while the paper supply, much of which is shorted, numbers in the trillions. For every ounce of physical Silver, there is two ounces in short positions. Also, for every dollar that spot Silver rises, the shorts will have to close over $200 million in positions. A purchase of just a fraction of the $20 billion in physical Silver and it's counterparts (AG, SLV, etc.), will likely trigger the price to skyrocket. Remember the benchmark: At $500, most big banks will be forced to close their shorts at phenomenal losses.

The time will come, my friends, where GME has given us a full and wonderful victory. When that time comes, Silver will be heading to the moon, then the stars, and will finally reach it's true value. 🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑🌑

WE LIKE THE METAL

tldr: Buy and Hold $GME, but let's show big banking what we can do.

"Here is some enlightening information regarding the potential situation at RH.  

But first I want to tip my hat and salute the effort of this WSB group and the balls displayed throughout the week by all its members as seen in the market action.  I spent a long time inside the banks and know how things work there, the bullshit, politics, collusion and yes... its all stacked up against the individual investor.  Myself, and i know a bunch of people who are silently rooting for you guys.  So I simply could no longer stay on the sidelines reading.  I want to help and contribute and shed some light by adding  to the post by ""theaback"" which seems to be correct.

Basically, numnuts CEO from RH should have never gone on TV yesterday.  He was awful and did not really answer the questions directly.  It did not inspire comfort and confidence because we all know someone is pressure him into making restrictions happen.  He did not have the guts to say who.  But every other broker who was questioned has no problem answering.

Earlier today I read an article from Zerohedge.  Here are some excerpts:

""  Something bad is about to go down at Robinhood.

  
One day after the company drew down on its bank lines and obtain a $1 billion rescue capital investment, the company found itself in lockdown mode, allowing just a handful of shares to be bought at a time, effectively shutting down in all but name (it couldn't risk another day of furious public outcry and massive client departures if it blocked trading completely).  


However, just before the close, things got downright surreal when in a blog post the broker - which should probably change its name from Robinhood to Suit - made a shocking announcement: going forward, customers will be subject to maximum aggregate limits in 50 securities of which 14 are capped at position limits of just 5 shares, **while allowing total holdings in 36 securities to be just one share**!

  
In other words, as of this moment, no client is allowed to one more than 1 share in names like GME, AMC, AG, BBBY, BYND, WKHS and many others. **Even boring, low vol names like GM and SBUX are limited to just one share** AAL AMD and even GM are restricted to 1 single share!!!!!

 Panicked clients who are wondering if this means that their current holdings which exceed 1 laughable share will be forcefully liquidated can breathe for now: the company said that ""outside of our standard margin-related sellouts or options assignment procedures, **your positions will not be sold for the sole reason that you are currently over the limit.** However, you will not be able to open more positions of each of these securities unless you sell enough of your holdings such that you are below the respective limit."" (we expect that to change on Monday, if the company is still around.)

In other words, virtually nobody can buy any *new* securities. The company also disclosed that no fractional shares can be bought going forward as ""fractional shares are currently position closing only for all of the securities listed in the table above. This means you can sell and close your fractional positions, but you can't open new fractional positions. However, you can still open new whole share positions according to the limits listed above."" 

Why is this happening? The most likely reason is that between DTC, clearinghouses and other regulatory entities, Robinhood was found to be in another capital deficiency position - even with the billions raised overnight - and it is being forced to deliver.

  
This likely means that Robinhood is as of this moment, scrambling to obtain even more capital, although we somehow doubt it will be just as easy to ""take from the rich"" as it was late last night especially since the client exodus is surely accelerating.

  
It also means that we may have to have another ""Lehman Weekend"" situation on our hands, only this time it will be a ""Robinhood Weekend"", and an urgent acquisition from a strategic buyer may be required to prevent the worst case outcome. We only hope that the billions in funds held in custody for clients is segregated should the company collapse (pinging Jon Corzine here). 

In any case, expect a lot of Robinhood related news over the weekend. ""

So last time I saw something like this, aka ""a run on the bank"" was in fact Lehman and Bear Stearns in 2008.  They are gone.  Before that it was MF Global and Revco, look it up guys, they are gone as well.  Not only that, the people who had their money there spent a ton of cash on lawyers and it took years to recover a fraction of their capital. 

Hope this helps!!

"Me again. Yesterday [you took my suggestion](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6z7rx/the_hedge_fund_citadel_pays_robinhood_for_their/gl3tlna/) and drove [unbelievable amounts](https://twitter.com/fordm/status/1354856454822486017?s=20) of calls/emails/etc to politicians and offices that needed to hear how pissed off we were that market manipulation was happening in front of all our eyes to protect the rich and fuck the rest of us. 

As of today, several state AG offices have announced investigations, and both the [House Financial Services Committee](https://twitter.com/FSCDems/status/1354901344704991232) and the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/brown-says-senate-panel-to-hold-hearing-amid-gamestop-frenzy) have officially announced hearings into the events around Citadel, online brokers, and Gamestop. 

Pause for a second to understand how insane that is. 

Here's a list of things that haven't received hearings:

* 400k+ covid deaths
* $2k stimulus
* vaccines
* flint water
* Jan 6th capitol events
* healthcare

But in one fucking day we went from many of you saying nothing would happen, to asking me and others for advice on making your first calls to your elected officials, TO HAVING SENATE AND HOUSE HEARINGS ANNOUNCED. THIS IS FUCKING UNPRECEDENTED!!!!

We are 6 million members strong now. As congress moves into these hearings, our voices will be drowned out by massive political contributions from the finance and banking industry, and the same people who manipulated everything yesterday that inspired us to call in the first place.

**If you want to fight back, we have to organize. To organize, I suggest we form a WSB Political Action Committee, and take our fight to DC to make sure our voices continue to be heard.**

If /r/wsb 6mil+ members all gave $10 each to a WSB PAC, we would have $60mil to fight for the common American in DC, and 6 million people ready to make calls and send emails at the first signs of fuckery. Do you understand how incredible it is that yesterday - for the first time in the last four years - members of both parties agreed on the same thing??? 

**We just started. We need to capitalize on that momentum. If you are interested in supporting a WSB PAC and fighting back, I've created wsbpac.substack.com, and wsbpac@gmail.com, to collect contact information for anyone interested. It would take a few days to actually organize a PAC and collect funds, but the time to strike is now while we're all pissed and we have Congress' ears.**

Right now we just need to gauge interest. If enough people are interested we can set formal definitions of the PAC, clearly defined and transparent goals, and meet standard of integrity to ensure money and support is used how it is supposed to be used. It will also give us an opportunity to ask Mark Cuban, Elon, Chamath, and others who have supported this movement in spirit, to now support this movement financially. 

What say you WSB? ARE WE DOING THIS?

As of today, several state AG offices have announced investigations, and both the [House Financial Services Committee](https://twitter.com/FSCDems/status/1354901344704991232) and the [Senate Banking Committee](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/brown-says-senate-panel-to-hold-hearing-amid-gamestop-frenzy) have officially announced hearings into the events around Citadel, online brokers, and Gamestop. 

Pause for a second to understand how insane that is. 

Here's a list of things that haven't received hearings:

* 400k+ covid deaths
* $2k stimulus
* vaccines
* flint water
* Jan 6th capitol events
* healthcare

But in one fucking day we went from many of you saying nothing would happen, to asking me and others for advice on making your first calls to your elected officials, TO HAVING SENATE AND HOUSE HEARINGS ANNOUNCED. THIS IS FUCKING UNPRECEDENTED!!!!

We are 6 million members strong now. As congress moves into these hearings, our voices will be drowned out by massive political contributions from the finance and banking industry, and the same people who manipulated everything yesterday that inspired us to call in the first place.

**If you want to fight back, we have to organize. To organize, I suggest we form a WSB Political Action Committee, and take our fight to DC to make sure our voices continue to be heard.**

If /r/wsb 6mil+ members all gave $10 each to a WSB PAC, we would have $60mil to fight for the common American in DC, and 6 million people ready to make calls and send emails at the first signs of fuckery. Do you understand how incredible it is that yesterday - for the first time in the last four years - members of both parties agreed on the same thing??? 

**We just started. We need to capitalize on that momentum. If you are interested in supporting a WSB PAC and fighting back, I've created wsbpac.substack.com, and wsbpac@gmail.com, to collect contact information for anyone interested. It would take a few days to actually organize a PAC and collect funds, but the time to strike is now while we're all pissed and we have Congress' ears.**

Right now we just need to gauge interest. If enough people are interested we can set formal definitions of the PAC, clearly defined and transparent goals, and meet standard of integrity to ensure money and support is used how it is supposed to be used. It will also give us an opportunity to ask Mark Cuban, Elon, Chamath, and others who have supported this movement in spirit, to now support this movement financially.

AG is gonna squeeze so why buy SSV? The shares traded today in AG could have bought SSV 10x. These little juniors have been pushed around and had any upside momentum crushed by short interest. Losses are mounting and the BIGS will be looking to these junior moon shots to get on the right side of the trade. Don't let them. SLV gonna squeeze, AG gonna squeeze and their life rafts are the juniors. Throw SSV a fuckin glance (SSVFF otc and SSV.V for the snow mexicans). A blow out in one will rattle the others and make those twonk banksters pay up.

SLV, AG and SSV!

I like the stock.

&#x200B;

With some attention SSV is an easy 10x and will mature at a time when a bunch of retards need to double and triple up on SLV

&#x200B;

I own it, I bought more yesterday and I'll buy more today. Its not just a shell co. either. It has a good asset, good mgmt, and short interest has been all over it.

"Making a case for silver

Fellow retardz, there has been a discussion about buying SVR SIVR AG and the likes in order to reck some big banks. Here is why I think this is the best idea yet:

Silver has intrinsic value that goes beyond some company's ability to generate cashflow... Silver is necessary to make our electronics, including Photovoltaics and other devices that play a large role in our shift to green tech. And under the new Biden administration, it is obvious that this shift will accelerate, and so will the need for Silver.

Silver is also a rather limited resource. Did you know that there is only one mine in the world that specifically mines silver? That's because silver is found spread out in the ground in vein-like formations and is usually not practical to mine it directly. So it's extracted as a by-product of mining other metals. Also, about 55% of all silver is used in electronics, and because most of the world doesn't recycle their electronics properly, a lot of it ends up being locked away for good in landfills. 

Obviously, silver is a very versatile commodity that is used both in the manufacture of electronics, as well as household goods (silverware) and jewelry. It has phenomenal conductivity, and even antimicrobial properties (small amounts of silver can be used to disinfect water). 

And on top of all that, silver has been getting shorted on paper for years, while the same people shorting it have also accumulated large quantities of physical bullion. Let's part them with their hoarded silver by making them having to sell it off to cover their shorts that we are about to WRECK!

So, in conclusion, we have a commodity that has enormous intrinsic value, that is about to be in even higher demand due to our green shift, its price is artificially suppressed, and we could use it to really damage some banksters. We've got nothing to lose! I am buying $50K worth of SVR and SIVR, but it doesn't matter if you buy ETF's or mining stocks, we we push one thing up, the rest will follow due to arbitrage. 

Let's do this!","Making a case for silver

Not necessarily squeezing 1 company like AG but the finite resources; silver. Are you seeing it differently?",-0.342

"SLV is supposed to have value from silver, but that silver doesn’t exist. There isn’t enough in the world if you look deeper, yes SLV pops up as a top silver stock BUT a lot of people don’t understand that it’s supposed to be a representation of a fund back up by the actual commodity it represents; which it doesn’t currently. The only way to do real damage with SLV is if people used it to demand delivery of physical silver. Or just squeeze $AG cause the company is amazing and so is the CEO.","SLV is supposed to have value from silver, but that silver doesn’t exist.

"Hello fellow traders,

Like you, I am completely disgusted by the actions Robinhood and others have taken to manipulate the market. In response, I have written this letter that you may use to send to your respective Attorney General of the state you live along with any congressmember and state representative. I have removed my state and put in XXX where you can fill in your respective state and you may also fill in your attorney general's name at the top. 

These actions set dangerous precedents that could allow for these companies to do this in the future if their reckless shorting results in them incurring losses. We cannot allow this to happen on our watch or on our dime. 

I have never seen so much community from one subreddit that I've seen here. I have seen countless stories about how this subreddit has helped people pay off their college debt, donate to countless Charites and help their family. We can no longer allow large multibillion dollar hedge funds to bully the little guy. 

It is time to show them that we can fight back... and we will fight back. Urge your state's AG to join this suit.

Office of the XXX Attorney General

(include their office address as well)

Dear Mister (Or Madam) Attorney General XXX,

I am writing this letter to you today out of concern in response to the drastic steps trading platforms, namely Robinhood Financial LLC, have taken to effectively halt trading on certain company stock and force its sale. This is of great concern because it strikes at the very core of our free and open market because no one person or institution may influence the market. Pursuant to Robinhood’s own disclaimer, under section C it reads in part “I understand that all investments involve risk, that losses may exceed the principal invested, and that the past performance of a security, industry, sector, market, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns”. I, along with others who use this trading application, agreed, and accepted this condition. It would appear that the hedge funds and other institutional trading instruments refused to heed this warning and engaged in reckless short selling of these companies that Robinhood has now attempted to block. Moreover, their reckless short selling has caused their institutions to lose billions of dollars because of their own greed which brings me to my concern today.

I believe that the halting of trading on these positions of a select few companies effectively manipulates the market and in turn helps these institutional trading companies, mainly Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital, to recover their losses at the expense of XXX investors. In concert with Robinhood, these institutional investment companies have forced XXX investors to cover the immense losses because of their own reckless shorting of GameStop and others by directly giving XXX investors the only option to sell these companies for a loss. As of this writing, Robinhood only allows for the option to close positions on GameStop and others and does not allow for the free market acquisition of more securities of these publicly traded companies.

I ask that your office investigate the alleged connection between Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital with Robinhood Financial LLC and their alleged collusion and subsequent market manipulation. I would ask that the state of XXX joins in with the class action lawsuit that is being filed against Robinhood Financial LLC currently in the works. 

Our free market system hinges on the ability for all citizens to engage in the sale and acquisition of securities at their own risk. The actions of a few large financial corporations do not have the authority to manipulate the market to cover their own recklessness. If nothing is done in response to this, I fear that these trading institutions will be able to, at will, hedge their risk with the knowledge that they can shut down trading on a current stock if it exceeds their risk tolerance. This idea cuts at the fundamental idea of free market capitalism and is a dangerous precedent if nothing is done to address these concerns. 

Thank you for your consideration on this matter.","Hello fellow traders,

Poor college graduate here, being fucked over by the system as usual. I've been reading up a lot on physicals recently, silver and gold and such. Banks and other financial institutions have historically suppressed these assets and as I understand it, many who have been in the game for a while see the market manipulation often. I feel that this whole situation is really good, and highlights the obscene flaws in our financial system. And physicals, such as silver, have the potential to go to the thousands.

As daddy Elon once said, if you're young and have nothing to lose, take that risk. This is me spending my last $1k on $AG. FUCK IT.

$AG vs $SLV (Which is the right Silver Stock to Buy?)

$AG is the clear choice in this situation- don’t mess with the actual silver reserves. USGOV would intervene in that meteoric of a rise ASAP, cutting profits short. AG on the other hand is a producer of silver. Silver is traditionally worth less than the cost of extraction. Higher AG stock price = more efficient mining tech = rise in value of silver. Also squeeze the bastards who shorted this stock. Currently 22% of float is shorted.

Silver is also a key component in solar panels, and I speculate that regardless of any push of concentrated effort, with the rapid development of the EV and solar markets, silver will be on the rise soon.

The current situation truly highlights how large corporate interests, financial institutions, and groups of the more affluent have traditionally suppressed and manipulated global markets to keep the rich richer and the poor poorer. With places like Robinhood LITERALLY PREVENTING US FROM BUYING, the evidence is clear.

Its unfortunate that mainstream investing institutions such as Robinhood are suppressing people so hard, Hopefully this doesn't prevent from selling/buying.

UPDATE: As I was typing this draft out, I learned that RH is blocking even more stocks, in addition to many other platforms following the same procedure.

In conclusion, I'm buying $AG. FUCK IT.

"Don't know why this was removed. Physical Silver is going to go to the moon, but don't get paper silver. Most ETFs where you can buy silver (**AG, SVR**) do not hold real silver, and thus are much more susceptible to shorts. ETFs like **SIVR** hold physical, and trade just as easily at similar prices. Right now, there are 500 silver contracts for every ounce of physical silver. If the markets decouple, that would mean disaster for paper silver.

**Reason one to buy: JP morgan** **Spoofing**: JP has a history of Spoofing on their metals desk, where they hold massive short positions for silver [Spoofing lawsuit here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/29/jp-morgan-settles-spoofing-lawsuit-alleging-fraud-in-metals-trades.html#:~:text=J.P.%20Morgan%20settled%20for%20an,plaintiffs%20%2430%20million%20in%20losses). Right now they are drastically increasing their hold of physical silver. [JP COMEX info here](https://www.jmbullion.com/investing-guide/pricing-payments/who-owns-most-silver-bullion-today/). They are using the shorts to keep prices low as they collect physical silver. They can then unload their shorts with paper once everyone realizes that physical silver is much harder to come by. why does JP want physical silver? they know that the size of the paper market is unsustainable. Paper silver can bubble, but physical silver at least has intrinsic value due to its use. this means two things

* Silver is drastically undervalued due to the short, and will naturally rise in price soon
* Silver is a great place to short squeeze

**REASON 2: Manufacturing vs consumption divide.** Physical silver is currently being consumed by tech manufacturing at a rate much higher than it is being produced. This is creating a demand crunch, but is not reflected in silver prices due to the vast amount of paper sponsored by shorts. The manufacturers cannot extract silver fast enough, and that is causing a supply shortage of silver. paper contracts cannot be used to supply demand, only physical, but prices are kept low because of confusion with the paper markets. [We could run out of silver due to the amount we use in tech products](https://www.401krollover.com/world-years-away-from-running-out-of-silver/).

**Reason 3: GOLD VS SILVER RATIO**. Gold and silver are both precious metals. the current [Gold silver ratio](https://goldprice.org/gold-silver-ratio.html) is 73x. extraction of silver is only 19x more than gold, and silver has non-recycleable consumption due to tech. the ratio of gold to silver should reach an equilibrium of the extraction ratio. the fact that it is so far away shows that silver will HIT THE MOON.

Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

So what happens when it all comes down? Something else has to go up, right? If the banks are fucked, and the dollar crashes, what benefits? The super rich always take advantage of a crisis. They move their money to what is going to win from the crisis, in this case, gold and silver. Gold options are expensive, but silver seems cheap.

"Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* Once again, Stimulus Talks are going well. Congress continues to edge along the market, with current package pricing around $900b and contentious items such as liability protection along with state and local funding are off the table. Chatter says a direct payment stimulus check is included BUT the amount has not been fully disclosed yet. It is likely to be LESS than $1,200 to keep the price tag of the package in check (likely $600 for the plebs). McConnell has noted that they will NOT leave town until a law is passed. After 6 months, we totes believe them.
* BofA resumes coverage of MSFT with a bigly $256 price target, MSFT is up 2.4% during intraday high, despite AMZN pleading with the courts again to hold the 10b JEDI contract cuz Orange POTUS may have exerted undue influences on Pentagon's decision. Antitrust shit continues as Google is now being sued by TX AG over abuse of ad tech. (Who's still under FBI investigation for bribery and abuse of office. Let's see if POTUS pardons him if the ban hammer arrives now that the SCOTUS push went womp womp).
* Zuck boi complained that Apple's new iOS 14 with stringent privacy policy will have a harmful impact on many ""small"" businesses that are struggling to stay afloat. Aka fuck you Tim Apple how am I going to sell data if you lock that shit up? Shares are flat for the day.
* BA went slight red for the day after its CEO says via a memo that recovery may take 3 more years to achieve full recovery. Suspending annual merit salary increases in 2021 for most peeps. BA closed down 1.58% for the day at $255.87.
* TLRY gets a bigly lift today thanks to a reverse merger deal with APHA, soon to close the saga on one of the memest of weed stock (WSB will remember fondly when it halted multiple times in a day). TLRY is up 26% on the news during intraday high while APHA is up 4.43%.
* MT/Steel gang continues to pump in option land while the underlying is flat for the day, as call volume is well above normal and directionally bullish. 33k calls trading for the day, 24x more than expected volume as retail and funds get in on the steel train. Notable strike includes March and April $30c. Don't buy FDs you dumb fuck, the monthlies are cheap enough. Earnings is expected on Feb 11. Don't forget, someone's gotta be selling those options too.
* WISH, the discount market place where you buy shitty ass scammy Alibaba shit and post it online for upvotes, debuted today with opening trade at $22.75, below its IPO pricing of $24. Shares are down almost 14% for the day as it fades to $20.65 during intraday trading and closed down -16.45% to $20.05. Turns out not every ""tech"" IPO can be a winner.
* ABNB option trading debuted today with spreads as wide as my legs when Jpow offers me a brr. Shares ripped to as high as 12.4% during intraday, at $140. The stock closed up 10.57% for the day at $138.30. I had thought about a 140c FDs in the AM for about $1.6 a piece but pussied out. The strike touched intraday high of $6.90. Cool cool.
* FOMC release was in expectation as the Fed held rates near zero cuz money is brr, while committing to continuing buying bonds (at least $120 bil worth) till economy gets back to full employment. They see a 4.2% growth next year and a fall of unemployment rate to ""only"" 5%. Volatility ensued as 2PM struck and WSB screech in disbelief that a major Fed announcement like this can impact their weeklies. Buy the dip, retards.

* The problem Solvers Caucus continues to try and push their bipartisan relief bill along in Congress but faces the same challenges they've been facing with the leaders in each respective party unwilling to budge on their main demands (liability/lower price tag from McTurtle; state/local funding from Pelosi). Funny enough, talks of direct payments of $1,200 to Americans aren't as urgent now that the election is behind us and the only ones threatening to stall current govt funding bill over it is Sanders and Josh Hawley (MO GOP Senator).
* Recent IPO ABNB and DASH both received downgrades earlier this morning, with Gordon Haskett moving Airbnb from Buy to Underperform with a $103 PT, a 26% downside. Shares were down almost 9% intraday morning to $127 as it closed the down -6.64%. Meanwhile, DASH was downgraded from Buy to Neutral at DA Davidson but with a higher price target of $150, up from $93. Shares of DASH closed -8.57%. Both analysts cites valuation as main catalyst for the downgrade. No doubt some WSBer is still bagholding from IPO highs. Don't worry fam, your baghold will earn some nice upvotes when you post the screenshots.

"Tesla’s bullish momentum hits a snag as it stalls in the $600’s.  Tesla dipped sharply on Thursday before reversing.  It’s found itself right at $610 support on Friday.  If bulls can push it higher, the next resistance levels first lie at $628, then $660.  However, bearish MACD and RSI are indicating a potential break below $610 support to test $585 support, and if that level breaks then $575 would be next level of support.

Okay. And then in terms of the new shelf, I saw that you mentioned general corporate purposes. Would you consider issuing stock to repay debt under that program?  


**George Sherman - CEO21**  
No, that's absolutely not the intent. The intent here is to simply optimize flexibility and optionality period. There is a lot of unknowns going on in the marketplace with respect to this pandemic, ongoing flex of cases across the world, the impacts on our own businesses, and we're not immune to that. And in that regard, look, our -- we're going to continue to execute our strategies that have bolstered and strengthened our balance sheet. And you see all the work that we've done, including if we go back to even the long-term debt levels in early 2019 until today, it's -- as of this coming Friday, we'll have reduced our long-term debt over $530 million. By March of '21, they'll be over $600 million. In that same time frame, that same roughly 24-month time frame, plus or minus. We also returned over $200 million to shareholders. So I think, look, the goal is to continue to focus on running the business and optimizing the way we run the business, but also be very pragmatic and make sure that we have capital flexibility with no intention to do anything other than maintain our flexibility. Hopefully, that helps you.  


**James Bell - CFO22**And in so far that is concerned, we don't need it.  


**George Sherman - CEO23**Yes, absolutely.  
**James Bell - CFO24**We don't need it by line.

Our next question comes from Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.

**Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC27**  
With regard to the consoles, how did your allocation compare to prior cycles? I mean, presumably, you sold every single unit that you got. Is there still -- I assume there's still a very heavy backlog. And what are your thoughts on allocation through the rest of the period? We know Sony has come out and said that they plan to produce more. So can you share any thoughts on that?

**George Sherman - CEO28**  
Yes. I think the demand has been unbelievable, Joe, as you mentioned, and we don't see any end of that insight. So certainly, these are of technology, the demand is terrific for it. Any allocation that we get, and I think I've mentioned this on past calls, the answer is we always want more. I will say the competitive set has changed between console launches really with the evolution of direct-to-consumer from the OEMs themselves. So that tells you a bit about what the allocations look like versus last time around. But we're playing meaningfully, which was our objective, and we're winning well. So I think one area and a point of differentiation for us, and it's been part of our premise all along is we attach differently. So when you look at accessories, first-party software, we attach differently, and that's been recognized, and we have seen some level of reward for that, and we expect it to be a differentiating point for us going forward in terms of allocation.

**Joseph Feldman - Telsey Advisory Group LLC29**  
That's helpful. And then just another question. With regard to the cash balance, I mean, I know that some of it's restricted, but you have $603 million, presumably, you generate even more in the fourth quarter. Let's say, we're getting through this cycle with the pandemic. I understand that couple of months are going to be rough. But I guess, how are you thinking about a cash allocation or cash usage at this point. I know we've talked to people that are hoping you were going to buy back more stock in the coming years, so -- or return to that. So I guess I'm curious how we should think about that going forward.

**George Sherman - CEO30**  
Yes. Thanks, Joe. The short answer is, again, nothing is off the table. I mean, our job is to find the optimum balance of capital allocation. Which starts with, ultimately, the investment in the transformation of the business for future growth and profitability. That's the first point. And we'll continue to do that. And if it means accelerating those investments, to bring that return in, in a more rapid fashion, we'll do that. It also is the fine balance of the capitalization of the business. And ultimately, what is the right level of debt, we think we're approaching that after we get done paying down the rest of these March '21s. And then outside of that, certainly always the consideration to return capital to shareholders as well as we've proven, like I said, last year, in 2019, returned over $200 million to shareholders. So I think every one of those is on the table, we are always looking to find the optimum balance of capital allocation.

**George Sherman - CEO31**  
And just to kind of add the obvious, the underlying environment matters, certainly, we don't know what a few more months means right now. We're obviously encouraged by a vaccine just like all of you are. But we see more impact ahead, and we don't know the exact time lines or protocols for that nor does anybody at this point. So we look at something that we have to be guarded about into the future is. There's no particular end date in sight yet. This is something we're going to be dealing with for the indefinite future.

**George Sherman - CEO34**  
Yes. We're not guiding to anything to come out with specific to growth and profitability in the fourth quarter. And just to be clear, again, we're not guiding to anything. Again, it's -- I think we've been pretty straightforward on that.

**Seth Sigman - Crédit Suisse AG, Research Division35**  
What would you call a sales year-over-year then? I mean, you're saying sales year-over-year will grow and there's a comment about profitability. I'm just trying to confirm, are you saying year-over-year profit growth in addition to year-over-year sales growth?

"Jesper Lannung lost more than $100,000 in August after getting trapped in a zombie investment product.

An exchange-traded note that he bet against was delisted over the summer by Credit Suisse Group AG CS 1.79% , relegating the note to the highly illiquid over-the-counter market. Mr. Lannung, a 38-year-old event planner in Milwaukee who layered a speculative trade on an already complex product, was forced to cover his short position after the note inexplicably surged in price.

The swing was so dramatic that regulators eventually halted trading. Credit Suisse then liquidated the note and brought its share price back to reality. Those actions, however, were too late to protect some investors including Mr. Lannung.

“This was absolutely frightening for our family,” he said, adding that the loss wiped out a significant chunk of the investment portfolio he managed for himself and his parents.

Analysts said those circumstances aren’t that unusual in the ETN market and could recur. A number of high-profile implosions have sapped investor demand for the products, spurring a wave of ETN closures by the banks that issue them.

ETNs are the more-complex and riskier cousins of exchange-traded funds. Like ETFs, they track the price of a basket of stocks, bonds or commodities, but they don’t own the underlying assets they track. Instead, they are essentially debt issued by a bank that matures by a certain date, similar to a corporate bond.

Some use risky features, such as leverage, to magnify gains and losses. They can also seek to return the opposite, or inverse, of a particular asset. Both of those features were used in the product Mr. Lannung had been shorting.

The size of the ETN market has declined to $8.3 billion, down more than 70% from its peak five years ago. Banks are abandoning the notes this year at the fastest pace ever, according to FactSet, closing 52 products so far and putting 2020 on track to eclipse the record 58 closures in 2018.

But some ETNs, like the Credit Suisse product, don’t die a quick death.

Banks can either liquidate a note by accelerating its maturation, or by delisting it, depending on how the product is structured. Under the latter option, a bank can slowly starve ETNs of assets on the over-the-counter market, while also shutting off a crucial mechanism that keeps the notes’ prices in line with the indexes they track. Because the notes are still trading, the banks can continue to collect a management fee on the remaining investor cash in the notes.


‘This was absolutely frightening for our family,’ said Jesper Lannung, on getting trapped in a zombie investment product.
ETNs that account for some 15% of the total market are currently lingering in that state—potentially leaving investors vulnerable to dramatic price swings and mammoth losses in a market known for its thin liquidity.

“I would say it’s the Wild West, but the Wild West seems rather tame as a metaphor,” said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research at FactSet. “I would say directly to the issuing banks: Is that the story they want to be associated with? Is it worth whatever benefit they do retain by keeping these notes in the limbo of the pink sheets?”

Credit Suisse could have accelerated the closure of the note that Mr. Lannung bet against—the VelocityShares 3x Inverse Natural Gas ETN—and a spokeswoman for the bank declined to say why it chose to delist it initially. She said that the move wasn’t motivated by fees and that the bank takes the stability of markets and precedent into consideration when deciding how to treat an ETN closure.

Analysts argue that particular ETN and others that are delisted are anything but stable once they enter the over-the-counter market, adding that issuers should immediately close unsupported notes if they have that option.

Problems with the natural-gas ETN started soon after Credit Suisse said in June it would delist and halt the issuance of further shares of the note and eight others. Before the announcement, its shares traded at about $370, roughly in line with the note’s indicative value.

Some investors, likely institutions that trade a large number of securities for quick gains, continued to trade the note even after it was delisted, pushing its price higher. By the end of July, the Credit Suisse note’s price was more than double its indicative value.

Mr. Lannung said he didn’t notice until early August that something was off. Prices eventually rose high enough that his brokerage, E*Trade Financial Corp., demanded that he start covering his position.

By Aug. 11, Mr. Lannung had closed out his shorts for a loss totaling $108,990.30. A day later, the note’s price touched $25,000, dwarfing its indicative value of about $124 a share.

The runaway note captured the attention of the financial community as investors puzzled over the massive gap between where it was trading and what it was actually worth. Short sellers alone racked up more than $2 billion in paper losses, according to data provider S3 Partners.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority took the unusual action of suspending trading of the note on Aug. 12. That same day, Credit Suisse accelerated its closure, effectively giving investors a cash payment in line with its indicative value.

Short bets against the fund likely contributed to the August surge, said R. Cromwell Coulson, president and chief executive of OTC Markets Group, OTCM 0.43% since Securities and Exchange Commission regulations can in some circumstances compel short sellers to cover their positions after a set period. But some brokerages refrained from forcing individual investors to cover their wagers, waiting until Credit Suisse adjusted the runaway ETN’s price and shielding their clients from massive losses.

Hassan Chawala, a 24-year-old textile exporter, at one point faced a paper loss of about $250,000 on the 10-share short in his account with TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. After Credit Suisse decided to liquidate the ETN, units were reverted to $90.16 each, netting Mr. Chawala $2,458.

“Just looking at it could give someone a heart attack,” Mr. Chawala said of the initial losses.

If E*Trade had done the same, Mr. Lannung’s shorts, which were mostly initiated at an average price of $172 a share, would have also been in the green. E*Trade didn’t respond to several requests for comment.

Financial executives and analysts in the ETN space said Credit Suisse mishandled the situation because the bank had the option to liquidate the ETN at any point. Other firms that were faced with the choice of delisting or liquidating ETNs, including Citigroup Inc., UBS Group AG and Barclays PLC, opted for the latter in recent months.

The other eight ETNs the Swiss bank delisted in June continue to trade over the counter, where gaps between share prices and indicative values have emerged. Shares of the VelocityShares 3x Inverse Silver ETN, for example, were worth nearly double their actual value at one point in August but have regained parity since then.

“There’s nothing tethering the price of these securities to their net asset value,” said Ms. Kashner, adding that the situation “absolutely could” play out again.","Jesper Lannung lost more than $100,000 in August after getting trapped in a zombie investment product.

## LG Chem to approve plan to spin off battery business on Thursday -Yonhap

SEOUL, Sept 16 (Reuters) - LG Chem  [051915](https://uk.tradingview.com/symbols/KRX-051915/) , an electric car battery supplier for Tesla Inc.  [TSLA](https://uk.tradingview.com/symbols/NASDAQ-TSLA/)  and General Motors  [GM](https://uk.tradingview.com/symbols/NYSE-GM/) , plans to approve a plan to spin off and list its battery business to help finance expansion to meet growing EV demand, Yonhap News Agency said. 

LG Chem plans to hold a board meeting on Thursday to discuss the plan, the report said. LG Chem declined to comment.  

The petrochemicals company previously said it was considering making its electric car battery business an independent company, without elaborating.

LG Chem, which also counts Volkswagen AG  [VOW3](https://uk.tradingview.com/symbols/XETR-VOW3/)  among its customers, saw its battery business swing to a profit in the latest quarter. 

It expects profits to rise, driven by rising EV shipments for European automakers and increased sales for cylindrical EV batteries used mainly by Tesla.

"Good luck to TSLA bag holderd

Volkswagen AG is in a position to overtake Tesla Inc., both in terms of e-car manufacturing numbers and software development, works council chairman Bernd Osterloh told Welt am Sonntag in an interview.

“If Tesla sets up three factories where 300,000 to 500,000 cars can be produced, then we are talking about a number of units between 900,000 and 1.5 million. We want to achieve the same in 2023, probably even earlier,” Osterloh told the newspaper.

"I’m further from Trump and the whole Russian mess than anybody who supports Biden. I just don’t pander to bad people because they happen to identify as Democrats. 

From a 2019 article on [Sentencing Project](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/private-prisons-united-states/), “the private prison population reached its peak in 2012 with 137,220 people. Declines in private prisons’ use make these latest overall population numbers the lowest since 2006 when the population was 113,791.” Who was President from 2009- January 2017?

Biden didn’t just sponsor the bill, he coauthored the 1994 crime bill. From an [NBC article](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/blog/rnc-live-updates-day-1-kicks-trump-pence-s-formal-n1237814/ncrd1237979), “Biden, then a U.S. senator from Delaware, helped write the bill, which was signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Critics in both major political parties — not only Trump, but several of Biden’s former rivals for the Democratic nomination, including Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., who is now his running mate — have said it contributed to mass incarceration.”  The irony of Harris, a former DA, AG, and all around agent of the racist legal system calling out Biden on his contribution to mass incarceration can not be missed. 

In 2019, [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-said-desegregation-would-create-a-racial-jungle-2019-7) published an article quoting Biden as saying, “Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.""  

Maybe he changed his mind on race relations since 1977, but gosh, who spoke at [Storm Thurmond’s funeral service in 2003?](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/joe-biden-strom-thurmond-eulogy)

So maybe he wants to fix things. Maybe he wants to improve things. But the thing is, it doesn’t really matter because:

1.	Guaranteed contracts get paid. That’s the point of guarantees, and why private prisons don’t really worry about little things like who might be president. 

2.	The Dems are arguably the flip side of the coin from the GOP. If the GOP is hard-right now, the Dems are Center-Right at best. In any other Western country, the Dems would be one of those parties that gets a place in government to piece together a coalition, but they’re not the majority party because they don’t really represent that many constituents. Right now, they’re the other party of people can’t stomach Trump. 

3.	What happens when the economy craters further? Do you think the Dems have the stones to stick with reforming the legal system and helping out us commoners when their corporate sponsors start complaining about lost income? Nope, they’re gonna bail out the corporations, then jail people for committing crimes when the lack of money drive people to survive outside the law. And we’re back to...prisons.","I’m further from Trump and the whole Russian mess than anybody who supports Biden. I just don’t pander to bad people because they happen to identify as Democrats.

In 2019, [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/biden-said-desegregation-would-create-a-racial-jungle-2019-7) published an article quoting Biden as saying, “Unless we do something about this, my children are going to grow up in a jungle, the jungle being a racial jungle with tensions having built so high that it is going to explode at some point.""  

Maybe he changed his mind on race relations since 1977, but gosh, who spoke at [Storm Thurmond’s funeral service in 2003?](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/henrygomez/joe-biden-strom-thurmond-eulogy)

So maybe he wants to fix things. Maybe he wants to improve things. But the thing is, it doesn’t really matter because:

1.	Guaranteed contracts get paid. That’s the point of guarantees, and why private prisons don’t really worry about little things like who might be president. 

2.	The Dems are arguably the flip side of the coin from the GOP. If the GOP is hard-right now, the Dems are Center-Right at best. In any other Western country, the Dems would be one of those parties that gets a place in government to piece together a coalition, but they’re not the majority party because they don’t really represent that many constituents. Right now, they’re the other party of people can’t stomach Trump. 

3.	What happens when the economy craters further? Do you think the Dems have the stones to stick with reforming the legal system and helping out us commoners when their corporate sponsors start complaining about lost income? Nope, they’re gonna bail out the corporations, then jail people for committing crimes when the lack of money drive people to survive outside the law. And we’re back to...prisons.",-0.85

">but be open to alternatives for strong solder joints when constructing for defense items

63sn37pb soldered is required by the DoD for all defense items. Partly because it is still technically superior to even sn-ag-cu alloys (its low melting temp and eutectic properties help to protect components from thermal damage during soldering), but mostly because it's limits are better understood. Tin-lead is stable as fuck over the long term, and while tin-silver-copper has some mechanical advantages, there are questions about its ability to stand up over the long term in some more chemically hostile environments. I also recall some issues when it comes to reflowing and repairing tin-silver-copper solder joints, compared to tin-lead, but idk for sure. 

Imo, the DoD will eventually accept tin-silver-copper for at least some applications, but they're still collecting the data to determine which applications they want to allow.",">but be open to alternatives for strong solder joints when constructing for defense items

"Trump doesn’t care about you or me; he cares solely about himself and has surrounded himself with yes men for years that sell their souls for money. There’s a reason Russia objectively wants and is currently continuing to actively help keep Trump in office. 

Trump is ripping down norms of executive power and the GOP is letting it happen. Russia pulled emails from both the GOP and DNC and yet nothing from the GOP ever came out to the public; all we heard about forever was Hillary’s emails. 

There’s a reason SDNY is going after all these people around Trump and has been trying for years to get Trump’s tax returns - and soon will get them. The writing is on the walls that he’s a conman and the walls are crumbling in. You can see that by the desperation to remove the AG in SDNY looking into Trump. To make it worse, he does this via Bill Barr as the AG of the Justice Department who has also torn down norms and allowed near transparent abuses of power by harassing people Trump doesn’t like and simultaneously helping Trump’s friends. 

I can ignore the BS medical advice he pushes. I can ignore the crazy stuff he says and does like suggesting nuking hurricanes, building an alligator moat along the Mexico/US border, injecting bleach, or staring directly into the Sun during an eclipse. I can ignore he’s clearly faking Christianity and the fact that his family is also a bunch of grifters using their positions to illegally make money while Trump is in office. I can even put aside all the ties to Epstein and how he wishes Epstein’s girlfriend well in a clear attempt to silence her about what she certainly knows Trump has done. 

I can’t ignore the blatant abuses of power to turn the US into a state where the president can do whatever the hell they want nearly completely unchecked while using the Justice Department as their personal protection. I can’t ignore Trump fucking with the basic tenants of democracy by sowing seeds of doubt for mail-in voting and simultaneously screwing with the post office and strategically telling states like Florida (full of old people who won’t go out to vote) to go ahead and mail in their votes. 

Trump cares about staying in office not because he loves America - he doesn’t want to end up in jail.","Trump doesn’t care about you or me; he cares solely about himself and has surrounded himself with yes men for years that sell their souls for money.

You should have looked longer. A month ago I made my own silver miner ETF:

MAG
SILV
AG

EXK
PAAS



But if you're not a total moron, you take your shit USD (because remember, if you're investing in metals, you're betting against your shit dollar) and you take it to the TSX. The TSX allows you to get into a less squeezed currency and reap better tendies for when DXY goes sub 80 in a year. 

TSX for above:
MAG
SLV
FR
FVI
EDR
PAAS


Problem is, some miners have already mooned pretty hard and since they had shutdowns due to covid, they don't have the silver reserves you would hope as they prices rise. So even with the increase in spot they are  only going to meet full year guidance. You saw this yesterday, despite silver going up like fucking 7%, all the above miners went down approx 1-4%. Fucking infuriating. Some are ranking pretty hard as it takes silver to go biggly up to even get them to move at all, while when silver goes down a tad, they dump hard and fast (I'm looking at you pre-market AG). So, have they run out is steam? Well I think EXK actually has for a while and they need to know that this silver price will stick around so they can have 1-3 good years of amazing returns. These guys are barely turning profits as it is right now. So yeah.....play safe out there boys.


Did you even look at split history and historical market cap? Almost positive we are near ATH for almost all silver miner stocks.","Sit down and I'm going to teach you something...
