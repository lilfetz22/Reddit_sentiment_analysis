1,"$CTRM has recently come off a year with -500% profits, but recently had a 3 month gain of 406%.

They recently expanded their fleet with 2 dry bulk carrier ships, adding to their 7 ship fleet.

Their execs are saying they will be able to reach long term profitability with these new ships, and will be able to move more dry-bulk goods. Which as of right now is an improving market.

Recently bought up 20K shares @ .36
