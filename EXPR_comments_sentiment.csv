## UPDATE: GameStop and AMC trading restricted by TD Ameritrade, Schwab, Robinhood others

10:40 am ET January 28, 2021 (MarketWatch) Print

By Mark DeCambre

'We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only,' said Interactive Brokers on Thursday

Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of certain companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors inspired by social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905)(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), along with other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies. ""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors.""

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but operates it as an independent retail brokerage, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those stocks, including [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905).

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, limiting how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""

On Thursday, Interactive Brokers Group ([https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interactivebrokers.com%2F&esheet=52369556&newsitemid=20210128005689&lan=en-US&anchor=Interactive+Brokers+Group&index=1&md5=8e527dd84e4d46012dbb5ce2a08ad471)(IBKR](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interactivebrokers.com%2F&amp;esheet=52369556&amp;newsitemid=20210128005689&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Interactive+Brokers+Group&amp;index=1&amp;md5=8e527dd84e4d46012dbb5ce2a08ad471)(IBKR)) announced that as of midday Wednesday ([https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005689/en/Interactive-Brokers-Takes-Action-on-Actively-Traded-Symbols](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210128005689/en/Interactive-Brokers-Takes-Action-on-Actively-Traded-Symbols)), it put [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905), AMC, BlackBerry Limited (BB.T) , retailer Express Ltd.(EXPR), and [Koss Corp](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=179137).(KOSS) option trading into liquidation only due to the extraordinary volatility in the markets. Meaning investors could only unwind their positions, not create new ones.

""In addition, long stock positions will require 100% margin and short stock positions will require 300% margin until further notice,"" the brokerage said.

""We do not believe this situation will subside until the exchanges and regulators halt or put certain symbols into liquidation only. We will continue to monitor market conditions and may add or remove symbols as may be warranted.""

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathering in online chat forums have gone on to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms including Robinhood (which in its initial conception was meant to be a social platform organized around the trading of stocks), have clashed with hedge-fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905) shares.

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905) and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in [GameStop](https://research.ameritrade.com/grid/wwws/research/stocks/summary?c_name=invest_VENDOR&issue=139905), and AMC Entertainment, has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with the likes of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) and retailer Express Inc. rocketing on Wednesday.

Recent volatile trade has made some on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a rapidly inflating bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, Massachusetts's secretary of the commonwealth, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday ([https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=mktw](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=mktw)) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

"I hope you guys realize that all of the NOK and AMC talk here is planted to distract us from GME. That they're sudden rise today of 200-300% was orchestrated by the short sellers to draw attention to them because they believe Millenials have such a short attention span that they can't focus on something for more than 5 minutes. 

They spent a few hundred million to pump up those stocks during the pre market, sent their paid army of redditors to say, ""Hey guys, how about that AMC?"" and then let it ride for the day, only to pull a coordinated sell after hours and dump GME, BB, AMC, BBBY, NOK, EXPR etc. all at the same time. Get people to panic and think, ""I should sell my GME so I'm still in the green for the day.""

Did you read the articles today saying ""Look at the reddit short squeezers bumping up the price of AMC, NOK etc."" THERE IS NO SHORT SQUEEZE ANYWHERE BUT GME.  The other cheap stocks that happen to have a relatively high short interest are not squeezable at all. 

Don't fall for their bullshit. These are relatively inexpensive tricks they're playing relative to the massive amounts of money they stand to lose in an actual short squeeze. Pennies on the dollar.

"UPDATE: GameStop, AMC trading is now being restricted at TD Ameritrade, Schwab
4:09 pm ET January 27, 2021 (MarketWatch)

By Mark DeCambre

Some major brokerage houses have begun to respond to a frenetic surge in the price of shares of companies that has been attributed to rabid buying by individual investors on social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop(GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings(AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the price of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" she said.

Charles Schwab, which bought TD Ameritrade but is still operating as an independent retail brokerage platform, said that it has tightened margin requirements in some of those trading names, including GameStop.

A Schwab spokeswoman said that the platform changed its margin requirements, or how much an investor can borrow, on Jan. 13 and said it has placed ""restrictions in place on certain transactions in GME and other securities.""

The restrictive moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January, as traders gathered in online chat forums to take large bets on the stock using options, often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Traders on sites like Reddit's WallStreetBets, and using trading platforms like Robinhood, have clashed with hedge-fund investors, sparking a battle between prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop shares.

A Robinhood spokeswoman said that officials at the popular trading platform ""continuously monitor the markets and adjust as we feel necessary for the benefit of our customers.""

Robinhood said it also moved raised requirements for GME and AMC to 100%, emphasizing that Robinhood doesn't allow shorting of equities or allow customers to trade naked options.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop has been spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertainment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc. (EXPR). whose shares were up 250%.

The recent volatile trade has even made some on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

"My theory is that it was propagated to help out shorters. They knew they were fucked with GME, so they bought large positions in AMC, bbby and expr at the end of last week (Thursday to be exact).

Pump it up enough and then burn it to the ground, taking huge profits to bail themselves out of their gme hole.

Honestly I'm a smooth brain and haven't looked into volumes traded etc but nothing is as heavily shorted as GME and once this got rolling, you can bet your ass the risk department at these hedge funds told them to dump all their other positions asap to avoid getting fucked by three dicks, rather than just one.","My theory is that it was propagated to help out shorters.

"😡😡😡😡MW UPDATE: GameStop, AMC trading is now being restricted at TD Ameritrade

By Mark DeCambre

At least one major retail-focused brokerage house is starting to respond to a frenetic surge in shares of companies that have been attributed to rabid buying by mom-and-pop investors on social-media platforms.

On Wednesday, TD Ameritrade said it was restricting trading for GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings (AMC), as well as other names, amid a triple-digit percentage surge in the value of those companies in recent days.

""In the interest of mitigating risk for our company and clients, we have put in place several restrictions on some transactions in $GME, $AMC and other securities,"" a spokeswoman for TD Ameritrade told MarketWatch, referring to the ticker symbols of the companies.

""We made these decisions out of an abundance of caution amid unprecedented market conditions and other factors,"" the spokeswoman said.

The moves come as shares of videogame retailer GameStock have shot up 1,600% in January as traders have been gathering on online chat forums and taking large bets on the stock using options--often out-of-the-money calls that pay off only if the stock rises in value over a set period.

Fanatics on sites lilke Reddit's WallStreetBets have clashing with hedge fund investors and have been casting the clashes been prominent Wall Street short sellers and individual investors in GameStop as a battle between deep-pocketed traditional investors and average folk.

However, the recent run-up in GameStop is spilling over into other areas of the market, with shares of companies like AMC Entertaintment also surging in price on Wednesday, along with shares of Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)and retailer Express Inc. (EXPR). whose shares were up 220%.

The recent bubblicious trade has apparently made many on Wall Street uneasy, with worries of a bubble. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite Index were all trading lower on Wednesday.

Regulators have been mindful of the recent action, with William Galvin, the Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, telling Barron's in an exclusive statement on Tuesday (https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-trading-could-be-systemically-wrong-massachusetts-state-regulator-says-51611705870?mod=hp_DAY_Theme_1_1) that he was watching the action play out.

""This is certainly on my radar,"" Galvin said. ""I'm concerned, because it suggests that there is something systemically wrong with the options trading on this stock.""

"i mean, Melvin is a $13B fund (or was at the start of the year, lol). They can definitely liquidate and cover their losses, if they haven't already. 

While i'm just speculating, i could definitely see other's believe that this rally can't hold up long enough, and they think that once GME stagnates and people realize how much money they've made, it starts a selling frenzy.

If funds truly believe that GME should be under $100, there is a shit load of money to be made here. If wsb holds strong in the face of all of this we can make a lot of money. it is up $200 today. shit ain't slowing down.

Not to mention that highly shorted stocks across the market are seeing crazy runs, maybe GME has invigorated the retail trader to start pushing the shorts, or maybe GME is just bringing more people into retail trading, but NOK, EXPR,AMC,BB, SPCE are all pushing up HARD.

This could be the industry turning event that makes short sellers reevaluate their risk models.","i mean, Melvin is a $13B fund (or was at the start of the year, lol). They can definitely liquidate and cover their losses, if they haven't already.

"Thinking Express (EXPR) could be a potential home run. Looking to add yolo April 2021 calls and a shit ton of shares. Talk me out of it?


They entered penny stock territory in September due to covid but still managed to survive financially. Bankruptcy highly unlikely imo. I think the worst of retail optics has passed. Nordstrom, Macys, etc have mooned but there's still plenty to go due to value. Express hasn't stepped up yet.


Shopping malls will make a comeback if these vaccines really do work. I know e-commerce has dominated but there's always space for B&M foot traffic. Express's demographic are neither rich people, teeny boppers, or welfare queens. Medium class have and can spend $$ here. It's $0.90/share now and was $2 in June. I think it's very possible we can get there again by April.
